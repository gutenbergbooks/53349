</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">“We study the past to foresee the future.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="in0">In these bustling days of headline-up-to-date newspapers,
one shrinks from reminding one’s readers
that Xenophon gave excellent advice to cavalry
trainers and leaders&mdash;advice which a cavalryman
will recognize is quite as applicable to-day as it
was in those distant ages; since details with regard
to grooming horses on hard stones, exercising
cavalry in rough ground, and so on are by no means
out of date. There is every reason to believe that
Alexander, and later Rome and Carthage at their
zenith as military nations, had proportionately as
highly-trained cavalry as is possessed by any nation
of to-day. Those who have fought in rearguards
and running fights realize that the Parthian method
of fighting must have required the highest training
and <em>moral</em>. The cavalry of the predominant nations
were drawn from those who kept horses for their own
sport and amusement, and for the gratification of
their pride, and who felt they were better fighting
men on a horse. The descendants of the horse-lovers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
of those ages are with us to-day; they are those who
love danger, excitement, and pace, and who find in
the blood-horse an animal which shares their love for
these, and will generously sacrifice its life or limbs in
the co-partnership.</p>

<p>Those who have never felt the sensation of a
really good horse bounding and stretching away
under them, and the consequent elation, the wonder
as to “what could stop us?” cannot grasp what a
cavalry soldier’s feelings are in the “Charge.”</p>

<p>Following the centuries which saw the final success
of the ordered phalanx of Rome, time after time the
more savage races of horsemen&mdash;Attila with his
Hunnish squadrons or Abdur-Rahman with Moslem
hordes&mdash;drive all before them, anticipating the flight
of peace-loving, easy-going farmers and traders, living
on the country and carrying off what pleases them.</p>

<p>Then held sway</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The good old rule ... the simple plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they should take who have the power,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And they should keep who can.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Ages roll by, the picture changes. The days of
Norman chivalry animate and fire the imagination.
The hunter warriors, knights, and squires lead their
troops in battle array, throwing them into the
combat at the decisive moment.</p>

<p>Broken bones incurred whilst unhorsing a friend,
or a shrewd spear-thrust when cleaving to the chine
a foe, in single combat, were adventures by no means
to be declined or avoided.</p>

<p>Chivalry or enthusiastic religious zeal qualify the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
rougher side of their devotion to arms and horsemanship.</p>

<p>In all ages the horse-lovers, the best-mounted
nations, have carried all before them. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ceteris
paribus</i> this is true to-day. Then came the days of
“villainous saltpetre,” and many began to doubt and
to number the days of cavalry; and always after a
time there rises the cavalry leader who, emerging from
the dangers of a youth spent in war and sport, sees
that pace, weight, <em>moral</em>, and the “àpropos” make up
for all the odds, if only leaders, men, and horses are
trained, and their weight and pace rightly applied.</p>

<p>Next in order come Gustavus Adolphus; Cromwell,
our great cavalry leader, and his Ironsides riding knee
to knee, and rallying immediately after the shock;
Frederick the Great, and his captains, Ziethen and
Seydlitz, and their ordered application of masses of
cavalry. Then grand old Blücher,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> and his antagonists
of the Napoleonic era, Murat, Lasalle, Curély.</p>

<p>Certain fixed principles keep cropping up which
appear to have guided these heroes in their
movements and dispositions. They are:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>
<ul class="in2"><li>A. Cohesion in the ranks, or knee-to-knee riding.</li>
<li>B. The moral effect of advancing horsemen.</li>
<li>C. The flank march.</li>
<li>D. The “àpropos” charge ridden well home.</li>
<li>E. Surprise.</li>
<li>F. The immediate rally.</li>
<li>G. The necessity of a reserve.</li>
<li>H. Training of the individual man and horse.</li>
<li>I. Care of the horse’s condition.</li>
</ul>

<p>The more we are able to read and learn of their
views of training, leading, and applying the shock of
cavalry, the more we see how little which is new
can be written on the subject.</p>

<p>The same view may be taken of the fire action
of cavalry. The best cavalry leaders have always
recognized its great value, where not put forward as
an alternative to the “àpropos” charge, and when
not substituted by the “weakening” leader for the
dangerous but more decisive shock action&mdash;that action
in which we must have “no half measures, no
irresolution.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> But the very fact that they may
themselves have at some time weakened to the
extent of shooting at the enemy from afar, instead of
resolutely going in at the unknown, must have made
these leaders recognize that the “charge” must be
kept in the front as our ideal.</p>

<p>Those who cannot understand the predilection of
the most advanced and thoughtful cavalry soldiers
for <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’arme blanche</i> should ponder on the success of
the Zulu dynasty. Its founder insisted that his men
should be armed only with the stabbing assegai and
would not allow them to throw their assegais. He
knew what shock tactics meant and the <em>moral</em>
inspired by their successful adoption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
A study of history shows the advocacy of ballistics
from the horse at a charging enemy to have been
periodic during the last 2000 years in peace time, and
also that failure has invariably followed its adoption
in war. It is not now seriously considered by any
nation.</p>

<p>Whatever the cost, whatever the method, he who
tries first to “handle” his enemy is the one with
whom “<em>moral</em>,” that incalculable factor, will rest.
Hear what a great trainer of cavalry, writing probably
over fifty years ago, said:&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>It cannot be too often repeated that the main thing is
to carry out the mission <em>at any price</em>. If possible this
should be done mounted and with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">arme blanche</i>, but
should that not be feasible, then we must dismount and
force a road with the carbine. I am convinced that cavalry
would not be up to the requirements of to-day if they were
not able under certain circumstances to fight on foot, nor
would it be worth the sacrifice that it costs the state.</p></blockquote>

<p>But if the croakers were alarmed at a sputtering
rifle fire, what will the faint-hearted of our time say
to the new and alarming factor which has now been
introduced. Batteries of horse artillery, firing up to
sixty or more low trajectory shells per minute, must
now be reckoned with. These shells contain 236
bullets, weighing 41 to the pound.</p>

<p>If the de Blochs and other theorists paused
and wondered what would happen to cavalry when
magazine rifles were invented, what will be their
attitude now? Let them be reassured. But the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
words of those who reassure them must ring true and
be purified from the dross of the first thought,
“How can we do this and save our own skins?” Let
them be born of the stern resolve, “At all costs we
will kill, capture, or put to flight our enemies.” We
must evolve tactics which will enable us to use every
new factor and to deny them to the foe.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>Leave them to judge whether the plan of those
tactics will be dashed off by the pen of the ready-writer
as a result of experiences gained during a
Whitsun-week holiday on some suburban training
ground, or whether the soldier who has felt the sharp
stress of an enemy’s victory, the heavy hand of
adversity and the rough lessons of retreat, who has
seen the barometer of his men’s fate rise and fall under
cyclonic conditions, will painfully and doubtfully
elaborate it.</p>

<p>Cromwell, Frederick, Galliffet, these with bitter
experience of the everyday imperfections of human
nature, and a well-weighed determination to insist on
tactics which will override those weaknesses, did not
attempt to avoid or shirk the difficulty of losses.
A cool contempt for the contingencies is the primary
qualification in the search for successful methods in
cavalry tactics, as well as in the encounter itself.</p>

<p>Turning now to the detached duties of cavalry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
of security and information, no less do we see the
recurrence of the same ideas. The Curélys and
de Bracks, the Mosbys, the cavalry who, “like a
heavy shower of rain, can get through anywhere,”
such come right down to us from ancient history.</p>

<p>The daring hearts who, trusting in a good horse
and a knowledge of woodcraft, torment the enemy,
whether in camp, bivouac, on the march, or on the
line of communication, are a product of all campaigns,
ready to the hand of those who know where to find
them, and how to inspire them aright so as to get the
very best out of them. And what will good men not
dare and undergo for a word of praise or encouragement
from one whose soul is in what he says?</p>

<p>Again and again, what is learnt in the hard school
of campaigning, and generally where that campaign
has been lost, carries the best lesson. Has any nation
set itself more resolutely to correct the faults of its
cavalry<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> than the French nation after the 1870 war?</p>

<p>Conversely, the nation that wins, learns little or
nothing; no lesson is worse than that of easy success
in small wars. Witness the Russian successes in
Central Asia for a series of years, followed by the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débâcle</i> of their cavalry action in the Manchurian
War when pitted against an enemy whose cavalry
was scarcely “in being,”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and the erroneous conclusions
arrived at in regard to cavalry by those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
who only saw the first portion of the operations
in South Africa 1899–1902.</p>

<p>Von Moltke is credited with saying: “People say
one must learn by experience; I have always endeavoured
to learn by the experience of others.”</p>

<p>The real lessons learnt from war are extremely
difficult to impress on the taxpayer, who, in modern
Great Britain, only reads of them in the newspaper,
and who at best does not wish to pay for one more
cavalry soldier than is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The cavalry leader must recognize that the arm
is expensive, therefore it cannot afford to be inactive;
it is the hardest arm to replace, therefore it must be
used to the full.</p>

<p>In all ages cavalry<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> have been expensive, and one
may well wonder if the frugal mind of the taxpayer
balances them against who can say what pictures of
dead and wounded, indemnity, pillage, lost trade, and
damaged prestige, or whether he looks at one side of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
the balance-sheet only, and forgets that from which
they may save him.</p>

<p>Ignoring these mundane views, it is still the duty
of the cavalry leader who has patriotism in his soul,
to keep his heart young and his muscles trained, and
to leave no stone unturned in peace time in his
preparation, as a sacred duty, for war; just as in war
it is his duty to sacrifice his men, his reputation, his
horses, everything, in order to turn the tide of battle
or render the victory decisive.</p>

<p>Let officers of cavalry remember that he who in
peace time cannot sacrifice his pleasures to his duty,
will in war find it much harder to give up his life or
aggrandisement, possibly in accordance with an idea
or order with which he does not agree, or in which he
sees no sense.</p>

<p>This is the serious side; mercifully there is a
lighter side to war, and it is well known that the hair-breadth
escapes of themselves or others, and the “hard
tack” form the most amusing and abiding recollections
of a war to those who have participated in it.</p>

<span class="subhead">ARMAMENT</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="center p0">“Quot homines tot sententiae.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">Armament also figures largely amongst conditions of success....
There can certainly never be complete disparity between the armament
and the <em>moral</em> of an army, since the latter includes intelligence which
takes care to provide good weapons. The want of good armament
immediately reacts upon the confidence of the soldier. Defeat would
thus appear excusable, and success cannot have a worse enemy than this
feeling.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Von der Goltz</span>, <cite>Nation in Arms</cite>, p. 147.</p></blockquote>

<p>The many changes through which regiments of
cavalry go in this respect are hardly credible,
although in our case allowance must be made
for the many different enemies which a British
cavalry regiment meets. The lance will be adopted
instead of or in addition to the sword, and six or
seven years later the sword alone, or perhaps even
rifle alone, will be carried.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> It may be regarded as
a certainty now that for some years to come, as in
the past, the Germans will arm both ranks with the
lance. One has hardly written this before one reads
that the bayonet may be substituted for the sword in
the armament of German cavalry regiments, for use in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
night attacks and in the attack of unturnable small
positions, or when occasion may arise.</p>

<p>The bayonet on trial is straight, 14 inches long,
with one cutting edge, the back being flat. All
under-officers and one-tenth of the troops will carry
a bayonet furnished with a saw edge.</p>

<p>History repeats itself. In 1805, Napoleon organized
dragoons who carried a bayonet as well as
a sword. There may have been a reason for this, as
their usual fate was to be dismounted and their
horses given to remount more highly-trained cavalry.</p>

<p>Von Bernhardi<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> sums up the question of this new
armament of the German cavalry as follows: “The
hand-to-hand fight on foot must be exceptional.
To injure the efficiency of the troops for their daily
rôle for the sake of such isolated occurrences I
hold to be a great mistake,” etc.</p>

<p>When we come to the pattern of swords, the
purely cutting sword has its strenuous advocates,
whilst as many more will beseech one to trust to
no personal weapon except the pointing sword.
Authoritative quotations will be given from well-known
leaders advocating one or other form of sword.</p>

<p>It seems to be allowed that a scimitar or tulwar
pattern, with its curved blade, is unsuitable for pointing,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
and also that the best patterns of rapier-pointing
sword are difficult to cut with. One may read in
Sir Montague Gerard’s book how he killed several
Afghans. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“One had but to make a feint of employing the obsolete
cut No. 7, and up would fly their guard over the face, when
dropping your point you went clean through your man....
The fourth man I tackled fired at me just as I closed,
and I felt a blow on my side, but next moment my sword
went through something hard, and the weapon was twisted
out of my hand and hung by the sword-knot. The blade,
which was a straight rapier, one by Wilkinson, got a slight
but permanent wave in it, and I can only account for
receiving such a wrench by having taken my opponent
through the headpiece as he crouched and tried to stab the
horse from below.”</p>

<p>Pages 255–256: “We counted sixty odd bodies, whilst
our casualties amounted to six men and seven horses.” And
on page 257 he adds: “The lance giving our Sowars a
preponderating advantage.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps of all those who have given their opinion
on this subject, that one to whom we would give
most credence is a swordsman of the 11th Hussars of
Marlborough’s time, who fought many duels and lived
by his prowess with the sword. His final dictum is:
“One point with the smallsword is as deadly as forty
cuts with the broadsword.”</p>

<p>Verdy du Vernois<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> says: “Experience has proved
that a sword-cut seldom, but a point with the sword
always, throws a man off his horse. The latter should
therefore be chiefly practised at sword drill.”</p>

<p>From the bolas of the South American to the
tomahawk of the Red Indian or the revolver of the
cowboy every weapon has had its advocates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Royal Artillery Mounted Rifles were seen charging
on horseback with fixed bayonets<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> a few days after
joining a South African column; thus imitating
the Australian contingent in the column, who invariably
did so&mdash;and very formidable they looked.</p>

<p>A conclusion which experience forces upon us, as
regards both the armament and tactics of horsemen, is
that when they attain a high standard of horsemanship
or when they are good horsemen from youth,
such as many Australians, New Zealanders, South
Africans, and Canadians undoubtedly are, a short
training will bring them almost level with the regular
cavalry and enable them to employ shock tactics.
Then they should be armed in addition to their rifle
with sword or lance, as the rifle and bayonet are not
the best weapons for this purpose. As trained cavalry
thus armed they are equal in value to twice if not
three times their number of mounted rifles on the
battlefield, if they have trained troop, squadron, and
regimental leaders in command of them.</p>

<p>The oft-advanced theory that it is not the nature
of such and such a race to use the point is quite unfounded.
It has been conclusively proved that a
recruit who has been allowed only to point with a
sword, can hardly be induced to cut, even if a good
opportunity offers.</p>

<p>The lance is undoubtedly the “queen of weapons,”
but it has its drawbacks. But first its great advantage
is that it is formidable, and so much so that
lancers claim that regiments armed with the sword<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
will not face those armed with the lance. It is
undoubtedly easier to use against crouching men
on foot. The Inniskilling Dragoons after a charge
at Zulus, who crouched down under their shields,
sent for all available tent-pegging spears.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the lance’s shaft is difficult to
withdraw from the body of a man, and a lancer may
have to leave it there. Then he will draw his sword.
But that entails another weapon. In a close mêlée
the lance is a clumsy weapon.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> In the mêlées
which occur after a charge, men and horses are so
intermingled that even the use of the sword is difficult.
But obviously the cure for this is to teach the men to
rally instantaneously and not to indulge in mêlées.
The officers of the 9th Lancers in the Afghan War
had a short spike put into the hilt of their swords, so
that a blow from the hilt in the face was decisive.</p>

<p>The weapon which (1) entails least weight and is
easiest to carry, and (2) is deadly, and (3) is most
likely to be useful on all occasions, is the straight
sword or rapier.</p>

<p>But this obviously must be made of the best steel,
whereas a quite serviceable cutting sword can be made
of inferior iron. That the cutting sword has been so
much used is most probably because good steel was
difficult to obtain. Napier says to arm cavalry
sepoys with heavy English swords of one weight, one
length, one shape is a mistake. The cutting sword is
not a deadly weapon, often it does not penetrate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
clothes or accoutrements. The mamelukes, formidable
antagonists to Napoleon’s regular cavalry in
Egypt, 1798–1801, carried a cutting sword very
considerably curved back, with which weapon they
are said to have inflicted terrible wounds; in
addition they carried a poniard and two pistols in
their sash and another pair of pistols in their holsters.
A syce carrying a lance for them followed on foot.</p>

<p>In the Peninsular War, whereas the English cavalry
used the sword almost exclusively as a cutting
weapon, the French dragoons on the contrary used
only the point, which, with their straight sword,
nearly always caused a mortal wound. This made
the English cavalry say that the French fighting
“was not fair.”</p>

<p>Some amateurs talk of the revolver as a weapon
with which to arm the ranks in place of a sword or
lance. They appear to ignore the fact that a bullet
once fired off in a mêlée may hit friend or foe. Very
fine horsemen, such as Arizona cowboys, who break the
insulators of the telegraph wire as they gallop along
with a weapon, which they have been accustomed to
handle from their youth up, would probably do well
in a pursuit with such a weapon, but it is not, we
believe, seriously contemplated by any nation as a
weapon for use in the ranks. For officers, scouts,
farriers, trumpeters, and possibly others it is most
useful, as it takes the place of a rifle and is light.</p>

<p>If any particular personal weapon is carried
habitually, that weapon should be adopted; but
failing that, there must be a long apprenticeship to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
lance or sword. Perhaps the point to which most
attention should be given is that the man must be
taught to have implicit confidence in his weapon;
this can be attained best with the lance or with the
pointing sword. A man appreciates the fact that
with either of these weapons the point goes through
easily; whilst with the cutting sword only the most
expert can make any impression on, say, a leg of
mutton covered with a sack and a leather strap or
two.</p>

<p>In the German cavalry, stress is laid on teaching
the trooper that the sight of the lance is sure to
make the enemy turn and fly. In our own cavalry
greater attention is now paid to practising the man
in riding at a gallop at a rebounding dummy, offering
resistance equal to the weight of a man. Without
such practice the men sprain their wrists and lose
their grip of the sword, and do not understand how
simple it is to run a man through.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Rifle</span></h3>

<p>Both French and German cavalry have, during
the last few years, been repeatedly urged by eminent
writers on cavalry to bring themselves to a better
knowledge of the use of the rifle and fire tactics.
The new weapon issued to the German cavalry
has been the signal for some of this literature.
Calling to mind that it is but a few short years since
German cavalry were armed with an out-of-date
carbine, and carried only some twenty rounds of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
ammunition, and further reading between the lines
of the latest addition to cavalry literature by
General von Bernhardi, these exhortations cannot be
considered as uncalled for. But to make them a text
on which to lecture our regular cavalry only exposes
ignorance of their present training, and makes one
wonder if one is awaking from far back in the middle
of the last century, when a gallant lancer regiment,
on being first armed with carbines, gravely piled
them on the stable-barrows and wheeled them to the
manure-heap. Our British regular cavalry are at
least ten, if not fifteen, years ahead of any continental
cavalry in rifle shooting, fire discipline, and the knowledge
of when and how to resort to fire tactics.</p>

<p>There are probably few of the more senior who
have not come to a conclusion formed from experience
that the following quotation<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> is as suitable
in many respects to cavalry as it is to infantry:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Volley firing, and limiting the range against infantry to
500 yards at most, are the surest means of providing
against the want of ammunition at the supreme moment.
And the sooner it is recognized that long range fire is a
special weapon to be used only on special occasions, the
better for the efficiency of our infantry in general.</p></blockquote>

<span class="subhead">THE HORSE</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">“A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="in0">No apology is needed for including in a Treatise on
Cavalry a chapter on the subject of the Horse. Were
it demanded, it would only be necessary to point
to the unfortunate ignorance in regard to horses,
horsemanship, and horsemastership which, extending
as it does through every gradation of rank of life in
the nation, caused our bill for horses in South Africa
to total twenty-two millions&mdash;that is, about one-tenth
of the whole cost of the war. In fact, it may here be
remarked that, following this assessment, it is quite
probable that the horse question should be rated as
10 per cent in the percentage of importance of
matters in preparation for war; that is, in big wars,
for our thoughts are apt to be distracted by small
wars from the essentials of great wars.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that nowadays only at most
15 per cent of the men in our cavalry have,
before enlistment, had anything to do with horses.
Further, few indeed of the officers, though most of
them have ridden, and in that best of schools the
hunting-field, have gained sufficient experience in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
their early life, before joining a regiment, in the stable
management and training of horses, to enable them
to look after their horses well. This they will
only attain to after they have had a fairly long
apprenticeship under a good squadron leader.</p>

<p>The essentials of campaigning horse management
only come to those who live with horses
constantly, and have to get work out of them.
Those who hand over their horse to a groom after a
long day’s work, and who do not see him till they
wish to ride again, cannot learn about horses.</p>

<p>That the ordinary hunting man in Great Britain
knows very little indeed about economizing his
horse’s strength is evident from the fact that not
one in twenty is ever, after a sharp gallop, seen to
dismount, loosen his horse’s girth, and turn his
head to the wind. Ten to one, if any one does
so, it is a soldier, and one who has served in South
Africa.</p>

<p>First of all is the question, What is the most
suitable animal for cavalry work? And here the mind
runs into two lines: (1) There is the animal which
will carry a moderately heavy man, whose weight is
11 stone, together with his saddle, arms, etc., which
may total up to another 6 stone. For this the
beau-ideal is the Irish horse of about 15·2 hands
high. But these must be well and carefully fed and
watered, and not overdone. Their recuperative
power grows less also with every inch of height.
(2) The other animal which will carry a lighter
cavalryman is seen at its best in the modern type<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
of polo pony about 15 hands high, and as nearly
thoroughbred as possible. These latter are more
able to withstand hardship than class (1).</p>

<p>Though the limit to the height of the horse
suitable for a campaign should be 15·2 hands, it is
more difficult to say how small a horse<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> is suitable
to carry a cavalryman. Chest measurement is the
best known test for stamina, and a good judge said
truly that “a 13·2 hands pony sixty-four inches
round, will do double the work of a 14·2 hands pony
of equal girth.”</p>

<p>Whilst we do not wish for one moment to be
understood to advocate unduly small horses for
cavalry, we do wish the chest measurement standard
to be adopted more widely. We cannot help
advancing the theory that the natural height of
the horse appears to be not more than 14 to
15 hands at most, and all above that are in the
nature of forced exotics, obtained by selection
and good food for mares and foals, and in these
stamina has not been grown in proportion; take, for
instance, the power of the heart, which has to pump
blood farther to the extremities in a big horse.</p>

<p>Now, though it must be allowed that a squadron
mounted on 15·2 hands horses will, in a charge, easily
defeat one mounted on 14·2 hands horses, still the
difficulty of maintaining the condition of the squadron
mounted on 15·2 hands horses, the increased cost of
food, the smaller amount of wear and tear which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
horse, as it increases in height, can bear, are all
factors for consideration.</p>

<p>It is because, unfortunately, our ideas in Great
Britain are somewhat inflated in respect to the size
of the horse required to mount cavalry, that we
neglected at the beginning of the Boer War to collect
every animal of suitable age, if only 14 hands high,
for the remounting of our cavalry in South Africa,
and went to other and far more unsuitable sources
for our horse-supply. Had we later, as was
suggested, commandeered all suitable animals in the
Cape Colony, we should have obtained a most useful
reserve, and incidentally deprived our opponents
of a source of supply of which they took full advantage.
The horse and transport animal of the country
are always the most suitable for a campaign in
that country. By the end of that war, many a
cavalry officer had gladly exchanged his 16 hands
horse for a Boer or Basuto pony of 14 to 14·2 hands
high.</p>

<p>But this, the South African War, it should be here
remarked, can only be regarded as giving us a view
of one side of a great question. Campaigning in the
fertile plains of Europe, where food and water are
generally plentiful, where stabling may often shelter
the animals, and where enormous distances, with no
food beyond that carried in the waggons, are not
necessarily covered, the larger horse may do his work
well. But he must be treated with the greatest care
and the weight carried, in his case, more rigorously
reduced than in that of the smaller horse. For shock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
tactics he is the best animal on which to mount our
cavalry, and our ideal is shock tactics.</p>

<p>But let the squadron leader not forget that,
when long distances are to be traversed, a few ponies
are perfectly invaluable (they can be driven in a mob
with his second line transport and are available to
mount men whose horses require a day or two’s rest,
and which will, if they do not get it, “give in” and
never be any more use to them).</p>

<p>In peace time, in the laudable desire for good
appearance, these expedients of war are too apt to
be forgotten; they only force themselves on us when
it is too late. The animals usually described as only
fit for mounted infantry are those which see the
finish of a campaign, and must be available as reserves
of remounts for cavalry.</p>

<p>No doubt it requires experience and trained intelligence
to discriminate between the purchase of
the large, fat, slow, hairy-heeled, podgy-muscled
brute that has never yet gone fast enough to strain
himself or be otherwise than perfectly sound, and
the lean son of the desert or veldt whose early toil
has developed wind-galls, splints, and so on, but
whose conformation and muscular development are
as complete as will be his ability to live and carry
weight, when the other will fall down and die.</p>

<p>Stamina has been mentioned above; it is obviously
the first essential in a cavalry horse. Next in rank to
it comes good temper, usually accompanied by good
digestion and boldness, and marked by a full kind
eye and a broad forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Xenophon recommends us to test a horse’s courage
by unaccustomed sounds and sights before purchasing
him as a war horse, and we recommend this practice
to cavalry officers.</p>

<p>The Arabs, who have bred horses with a view to
war for many generations, have handed down a great
deal of old-world wisdom on the subject of the horse
suitable for war.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> The best Arabian horses are undoubtedly
the outcome of centuries of breeding to a
type, and that the type suitable to carry a light man
throughout a long campaign, to face danger courageously,
to possess fair speed, immunity from disease
and sickness, especially pulmonary complaints, and
to bear the jar of galloping on hard ground.</p>

<p>Our own British horses and the Australian Walers
have unfortunately been bred for size, speed, and&mdash;in
the case of the former&mdash;ability to carry a man
in a burst over a big hunting country, and with, for
the last fifty years, a disregard for stamina and
temper which has gone far to remove many of them
from the type of animal suitable for cavalry.</p>

<p>Situated as we are in regard to knowledge of
horses, and hampered as we are in our preparation for
war by the difficulty of teaching the essentials of
campaigning horse management during peace time,
we shall always find that it is in the early part of
a war that our cavalrymen will fail to comprehend
the necessity for nursing the strength of their horses,
for discarding all unnecessary impedimenta, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
limiting the task to what is absolutely necessary.
In peace time, horses which are in regular work are
not appreciably affected by their rider sitting on
their backs for five or ten minutes at a halt instead
of dismounting, or by his not allowing the horse to
pick a few mouthfuls of grass twenty or thirty times
in the day, or by his not watering him at every
chance.</p>

<p>In peace time the horse will get food and water
on his return home; but in war these little things
in the aggregate matter greatly. They are like the
snatches of sleep which a tired man gets when he
can; they keep him going. The man can sustain
himself by the hope of sleep at a future time. The
man has certain traits in his nature which carry him
through.</p>

<p>It is said that Murat, in Napoleon’s Russian
campaign, though he crossed the Niemen with
43,000 horses, could only put 18,000 in the field two
months later. Murat had worn them out by keeping
them saddled up sixteen hours a day, by giving them
insufficient food, and by chasing wisps of Cossacks.
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">À propos</i> of this, Nansouty said to Murat: “The
horses of the cuirassiers not, unfortunately, being able
to sustain themselves on their patriotism, fell down
by the roadside and died.” Tired men soon express
their feelings, the horse is unable to do so.
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Verb. sap.</i></p>

<p>Intimately connected with this question is the
feeding of the horses. We know that no concentrated
ration can constitute a substitute for bulk for continued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
periods, but it is not generally known how
many articles of diet a horse will relish when hungry.
In the Pamirs the ponies eat the offal of game which
is thrown aside, thus recalling the story of our childhood
of Black Bess, Dick Turpin’s celebrated mare,
who had a beefsteak tied round her bit on the ride
to York.</p>

<p>Ruskin once said in a lecture to the cadets at
Woolwich:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whilst all knowledge is often little more than a means
of amusement, there is no science which a soldier may not
at some time or another find bearing on the business of life
and death; your knowledge of a wholesome herb may involve
the feeding of an army, and acquaintance with an
obscure point of geography the success of a campaign.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is applicable to the cavalryman and his horses.</p>

<p>De Brack devotes eight pages of his valuable work,
<cite>Cavalry Outpost Duties</cite>, to a chapter on “Forage
and Subsistence,” every word of which should be
known to any cavalry officer who may have to serve
in Europe or elsewhere.</p>

<p>The theory of horse management is brought now
to a very high standard by our Veterinary Department,
and their publication of an excellent book on
<cite>Animal Management</cite> marks a step forward which
must be appreciated by all who are in agreement
with the theory expressed earlier in this chapter, that
the horse question is one-tenth in war. It is little
different from Frederick the Great’s saying that
“Victory lies in the legs.”</p>

<p>One word of caution is necessary for those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
command cavalry in war. They must metaphorically
keep a finger on the equine pulse, and this is, most
of all, necessary when working horse artillery in
heavy ground, or horses fed on anything less than
full rations, or horses in bad weather. Wet saddle-blankets
put next a horse’s back act like a poultice.
There is no alternative in wet weather in a bivouac
but to keep the blanket dry, or dry it before a start
is made. Further, since the health of their horses is
vital to the efficiency of cavalry, their leader must be
willing to take risks in grazing, off-saddling, and
foraging for food. Against surprise on these occasions
long range rifles and our guns now confer on us great
advantages.</p>

<p>In this matter of attending to the welfare of the
horse, however, it must be fully realized when it is
permissible and when the horse must be sacrificed to
the exigencies of the situation.</p>

<p>An instructive example of what far-reaching results
may come from ill-judged watering of horses is given
in the <cite>American Civil War</cite>, by General Alexander.
In June 1864 Grant, after his encounter at Cold
Harbour with Lee, undertook the bold step of moving
south across the James River and attacking the
Confederate right flank. For three days, though
the movement was reported to Lee, he would not
believe it.</p>

<p>On the 15th of June the Federal General Smith,
with 1600 men, was moving on Petersburg, a vital
point on Lee’s right. Beauregard, the Confederate
commander, then had only about 2500 men to hold his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
extended lines with; he, however, expected reinforcements
by night. Every hour’s delay of the Federal
advance was therefore invaluable. With one cavalry
regiment and a battery he delayed Smith’s column
for three hours, and it was not till 5 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> that that
General had completed his reconnaissance of Beauregard’s
position. By 6 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> everything was ready
for the attack; but it was then found that the Chief
of Artillery had sent all the artillery horses to water.
This delayed the attack till 7 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> It was partially
successful, and a portion of the Confederates’ lines
were captured; but night came on, and with it the
Confederates’ reinforcements. “Petersburg was lost
and won by that hour.” That was on the 15th June
1864, and Petersburg did not fall into Federal hands
till April 1865.</p>

<p>The question, whether the present day greatly-extended
rôle of cavalry on the battlefield, hitherto
entirely confined to theory, will answer in practice, is
a burning one for the horse-master. Without an
enormous force of cavalry will there be squadrons
available for these services?</p>

<p>In Frederick the Great’s army the horses were
a first consideration, and he got the greatest results.
In Napoleon’s campaigns there is not much evidence
of the horses being considered.</p>

<p>Frederick saw that the task suited the horse.
Napoleon made the horse suit the task or perish in
the attempt. The latter’s lost campaigns teach lessons
about cavalry which we cavalrymen cannot afford to
ignore. Cavalry worn out in the first week of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
campaign, with scores of horses scattered along a line
of communication in vain efforts to effect some coup,
entail a bitter retribution.</p>

<p>Campaigns of three weeks’ duration are not the
rule, and every extra exertion for which horses are
called upon has its price. It is only in the pursuit
that we can afford to disregard our horses.</p>

<span class="subhead">TACTICS OF CAVALRY <i>V.</i> CAVALRY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">For the purposes of making this subject plain, the
Squadron, the tactical unit, will be first considered.</p>

<p>Let us picture, then, a squadron led at a trot
with absolute cohesion (that is, every man’s knees
close against those of the next man,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> but not so
as to prevent the pace being increased to such a
gallop as is compatible with that of the slower horses
in the squadron). This squadron being led till they
are within 50 to 100 yards of their opponents, and
then at a command breaking into the full pace of
the charge with a crashing, ear-splitting yell rather
than a cheer, will, it is universally allowed, go
through, break up, and cause to turn an opposing
squadron which has any intervals in its ranks.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
In the latter, men and horses can, since there is
room, turn or pull round; and they will do so.
Your men and horses cannot turn; there is no
room. Weapons in this case may be ignored, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
horses’ weight and momentum is the weapon. Horse
and man total upwards of a thousand pounds in
weight, they represent 9 feet in height by 3 feet in
width. The front extends for, say, 70 or 80 yards.
The pace is 10 yards per second. It is a rushing
wall, there is nowhere any gap.</p>

<p>The opposing squadron has started out with
equally gallant intentions, but before they reached
the charging point, or even later, something has
occurred to prevent them appearing like a wall;
more often than not their direction has been
changed, and, whilst shouldering, these on the hand
turned to may be closed up well enough, but those
on the outer flank have not had time to gain the
direction; pace may not have been uniform; a
direction may not have been given by the leader;
or his order may have been mistaken. No matter
what it is: fifty things may happen. It is just
enough to prevent that squadron being the more compact,
well-built wall of the two. And what follows?
They are defeated and disgraced. They will not, as
a squadron, again face the cavalry of the enemy
whose squadron defeated them. Better, far better
draft the squadron and send the leader to another
arm or work if, unfortunately, he has survived. Why
be so severe? Why treat them thus? Because the
heart, the <em>moral</em> of the defeated squadron has lost
two-thirds, whilst the winning squadron is elated,
believes in itself and its leader, and despises the
enemy. It will charge three squadrons next time
and will not turn. Still keeping before us the idea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
of a wall moving at speed, let us consider what better
fortune it may have; it may catch the enemy on a
half flank, or full in flank.</p>

<p>Place a row of books standing quite an inch or
two apart from each other, hurl a spare book at the
end book, and see what happens. At least four or
five will fall down. “Ten men on the flanks and
rear (of the enemy) do more than one hundred
riding in front.”</p>

<p>Trusting that this idea of a knee-to-knee charge,
the cardinal point, has been made clear, let us
consider the other matters which a squadron leader
should keep before him when opposed to cavalry. He
must utilize surprise, what Galliffet refers to as “the
horrible and unexpected”; he should always be “the
first to attack, always take the initiative, and charge
resolutely.” Again, our leader must utilize the
ground: first, its hollows and ridges must be accommodated
to his tactics; secondly, he should try to
give the enemy bad ground, ground which will tire
or disintegrate them whilst he himself uses the best,
since a ditch, narrow drain, or small nullah diagonal to
his front, a fallen tree, a patch of boggy land, a few
rabbit holes, some thorns or rocks may mean two or
three men and horses down or out of place.</p>

<p>It is certain that an enemy who sees your
squadron disappear in a hollow, as you advance
towards him, will, nine times out of ten, expect it
to continue its direction towards him; here, then, a
wheel to the flank, a gallop of a hundred yards or
so, followed by a change of direction, and later a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
wheel into line, may give the opportunity of a
lifetime.</p>

<p>These may appear small things, but they must be
second nature to a cavalry leader as they are to
some, and those the most dangerous, wild animals;
for in the skilled utilization of these small things lies
his honour and hopes of success.</p>

<p>Watch the cat tribe: deliberate preparations,
every advantage taken of cover in the stealthy
advance, then the gathering of the limbs under&mdash;for
the rush. From a fighting point of view we want
every instinct of this kind; with the cavalry there is
no place for “Gentlemen of the Guard, fire first”&mdash;cunning,
nerve, unflinching resolution, reckless,
bloody-minded intrepidity, and with all this the power
to inspire your command, even those of doubtful
courage, with the certainty of success; though they
must know some cannot come back, still they like
to be deceived, to die, or to be maimed, fierce, high-hearted,
happy, and elated. The sight of the enemy’s
backs makes them all brave.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Rally</span></h3>

<p>An endeavour has been made, then, to show that
the success of the charge lies: first, in the ordered
momentum of the unit; second, in the suitable application<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
of this by the leader. Disciplined experience
turns the scale. First, the impact, lessened in degree
as one side turns sooner or later. Then the mêlée.
These beaten back, the others victorious; these looking
for safety, the others for victims. Now, at this
moment the wild man’s first instinct is to pursue
“all out,” without a reserve, to kill, perhaps, a
weaker instinct, to capture, or to plunder. A new
element of disorder follows on this mad desire to
cast prudence to the winds and pursue, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’épée dans
les reins</i>.</p>

<p>Once more the governing mind of the leader must
assert itself, his foresight and knowledge must reign
supreme and repress the natural instinct of the many;
he by voice and example must rally his squadron.
Failing this, or a portion of his squadron held in
reserve, his horsemen are a prey to the first formed
body which attacks them, though of inferior
strength.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> “That side which is able to throw in the
last-formed body will win.” So excited is his
command and so irregular their course of action,
that he will have great difficulty in getting them to
obey him. <cite>Cavalry Training</cite>, p. 128, realizes this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As the pursuers will be in disorder and consequently
at the mercy of any fresh body of the enemy’s cavalry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
the necessity of organizing a support without delay is
imperative.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here let us remember that we have glorious
traditions. The name of Cromwell inspires very
diverse thoughts in the British Isles. To the Irish,
battered walls; to the Scots, ruthless discipline; to the
English, a constitution upheld or a monarchy overturned.
Suitable memories of our great cavalry
leader.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> To the cavalryman what does this man, who
can still inspire such diverse thoughts in nations,
represent?</p>

<p>The highest attribute in a general is that he
should be able to order the elements of disorder. War
is the acme of disorder. The instant conversion of
the available remnants out of disorder, chaos, a
hundred wishes, shouts and orders, broken legs, loose
horses, dead or wounded, men fierce and reckless,
constitutes the triumph of discipline and the guiding
foreseeing mind.</p>

<p>In minutes, perhaps seconds, the enemy’s support
or reserve, taking advantage in turn of our disorder,
will be upon us; we who have ceased to be a wall, and
are now scattered masonry, must be built up, so as at
any rate to <em>look</em> formidable and to make those of the
enemy, who as individuals still bravely dispute the
ground, turn and fly, and perhaps throw into disorder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
the ranks of those who are coming to their support.
More than this, we must move in the direction of the
enemy, as though we still wished to fight. As wind
is caught, stunned men regain their senses, disabled
horses exchanged for sound ones captured at hazard,
broken weapons replaced, the ranks refill, order at
last prevails.</p>

<p>We have laid stress on the rally of the squadron,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> but
hardly less important is the maxim that the victory
rests with those who can last throw a formed body
into the combat. This may be the support of which
De Brack says:<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Almost all the failures of charges are due to the
slowness or ignorance of the supports. A charge badly
supported, no matter how bravely begun, becomes only a
bloody affray, whilst one well supported is always victorious
and decisive.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us, then, for our guidance, and before
considering larger forces, formed of many squadrons
and supplied with another element of offence in their
horse artillery, consider what conclusions are arrived
at from the fight of squadron <i>v.</i> squadron. They
appear to be:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>1. Provided that there is space to manœuvre and fight,
that cavalry which can manœuvre with cohesion at the
greatest pace will win.</p>

<p>2. The element of surprise affects the result.</p>

<p>3. The utilization of terrain is a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sine qua non</i>.</p>

<p>4. A flank attack is the object to be aimed at.</p>

<p>5. On the quickness with which the rally is carried out
much depends.</p>

<p>6. A skilled direction of the support influences the
action.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="first"><span class="smcap">Forming to the Flank
</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“When you charge make a change of front and attack them in
flank. This manœuvre can always be successfully practised against
an enemy like the English, who make a vigorous and disunited charge,
whose horses are not very manageable, and whose men, brave but
uninstructed, begin their charge too far away from the enemy.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">De
Brack.</span></p>

<p>“Ten men on the flank do more than 100 in front.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Von
Schmidt</span> (p. 90).</p></blockquote>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The Squadron</span></h3>

<p>1. In the mounted attack of cavalry on cavalry
that side will win which makes use of a wall of
mounted men, advancing knee to knee with no
intervals showing. Two means of quickly forming
and launching this wall are as follows: 1st. The
head of the squadron column is directed towards the
enemy, and line is formed to the front. 2nd. The
head is led obliquely to the enemy’s advance, and
at such a distance as will enable the troops to wheel
into line, get up pace, and attack.</p>

<p>2. <i>Forming to the Front or to the Flank.</i>&mdash;The
first plan is that which the beginner almost invariably
adopts; the enemy’s squadron has a fatal
attraction for him; he distrusts himself and imagines<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
that there is not time to manœuvre. This attack
generally “leads to undecided cavalry duels.”</p>

<p>The second plan is that which is always advocated,
as, though it demands more <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sang-froid</i>, practice, and
experience on the part of the squadron leader. Its
advantages are considerable; they are as follows:
(<i>a</i>) It gives more space and consequently more time
to the leader. (<i>b</i>) The enemy’s squadron, if already
formed, will usually shoulder towards the attacker,
and thus become disintegrated. (<i>c</i>) The movement
does not entail the disorder consequent on front
forming; on the contrary, a wheel into line generally
ensures well-ordered and cohesive ranks. (<i>d</i>) The
squadron is usually successful in striking the flank
of the enemy.</p>

<p>Von Schmidt says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An attack direct to the front must be an exceptional
thing; to advance and at the same time gain ground to a
flank must be the rule.</p></blockquote>

<p>General Sir D. Haig says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The efficacy of flank attack is so universally admitted as
to need no argument to support it. A more difficult question
is&mdash;how should we protect our own flanks from attack?</p></blockquote>

<p>3. <i>Defensive and Offensive Flanks.</i>&mdash;Usually the
best protection is afforded by either a defensive or
an offensive flank; that is, a portion of the unit, say,
a troop from a squadron, a squadron from a regiment,
should drop back or be ready to drop back in echelon;
or, on the other hand, should be thrown forward.
The duty of the defensive flank is to act against an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
enemy overlapping or taking in flank the unit in
front. The object of the offensive flank is to threaten
even more completely than with the remaining force
the flank of the enemy, who will be tempted to edge
across to meet it.</p>

<p>What is true for a squadron is true for a regiment,
and is still more true for a brigade, because with
this comes in the question of artillery fire.</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Regiment</span></h3>

<p>4. Let us then picture a regiment moving in
“mass” from the south to the north of the paper,
map, or ground.</p>

<p>Our regimental commander seeing the enemy’s
mass in front and bearing down on him, say, eight
hundred yards away, gives the command, “Left
shoulders,” and moves N.E. The first effect is that
the enemy have a moving mark to hit, and to do so
must “shoulder” or change direction; while at the
same time they are deploying to the front.</p>

<p>Both forces move three hundred yards. Then our
regimental commander gives the command, “Echelon
attack to the Left.” The squadron nearest to the
enemy wheels into line and attacks; the remaining
squadrons continue their direction and wheel into
line in succession and attack as required.</p>

<p>The attack eventuates somewhat as in the diagram.</p>

<div id="i_I" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20.4375em;">
  <img src="images/i_040.jpg" width="327" height="509" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram I.</span></div></div>

<p>5. <i>Advantages of the Echelon Attack.</i>&mdash;This form
of attack has the following advantages: (<i>a</i>) The
wheel into line, the least discomposing of evolutions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
takes but a few seconds to carry out, and then there
is presented a formed body to charge the enemy.
(<i>b</i>) A succession of formed bodies coming up on the
unprotected flank give confidence to the squadron,
which feels it is supported by other lines near enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
to catch any outflanking enemy. (<i>c</i>) An echelon of
squadrons, seen from the enemy’s point of view at
a distance of three hundred yards, is practically
indistinguishable from line. It is, moreover, easier
than in forming to the front to abolish all intervals
between squadrons; a point of the greatest importance
in an attack. (<i>d</i>) To be the last to form the attack
from a compact formation is a considerable advantage.
(<i>e</i>) The leader may even be able to change the
direction of his mass so as to attack from due east
to west.</p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">The Brigade</span></h3>

<p>6. <i>Training of Leaders.</i>&mdash;Our present squadron
leaders, our future brigade and divisional leaders,
must be brought up to regard this forming to the
flank as the only plan, as second nature; they must
believe that if they act otherwise they are voluntarily
tying one hand behind their back. Otherwise the
maintenance of horse artillery with a view to co-operation
with cavalry is almost useless.</p>

<p>7. <i>Co-operation of R.H.A.</i>&mdash;In the cavalry fight
horse artillery is the only factor which has assumed
totally different proportions in the last ten years (<i>i.e.</i>
since Q.F. guns were introduced) to those which
formerly obtained. Von Schmidt, p. 163, writing in
the middle of last century, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The co-operation of horse artillery with the shock of the
cavalry must be a very exceptional occurrence, as when the
circumstances of the ground are very favourable, allowing it
to act and at the same time protecting it.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Nor does it appear that any instance of ideal
co-operation between the two arms occurred in
the War of 1870. With the old guns the help which
horse artillery could give was not great; and
consequently co-operation was not practised in peace
nor attempted in war.</p>

<p>Strange as it may appear, our cavalry officers still
find it hard not to deserve the reproach cast upon
them by the Duke of Wellington, who, writing after the
battle of Salamanca, remarks: “The trick our officers
of cavalry have acquired of galloping <em>at</em> everything;
they never think of manœuvring before an enemy.”</p>

<p>8. <i>The Two Forms of Attack.</i>&mdash;A brigade of
cavalry which moves in mass with its guns alongside it
and attacks straight to its front, masking its guns
by means of its squadrons’ extensions, voluntarily
throws away at least ¼ of its power, <i>i.e.</i> its guns. It
will be beaten every time by the brigade which sends
its guns to one of the flanks and goes to the other
itself. By this last method both gun fire and
charging power are fully applied. Further, it is
probable the guns will be able to enfilade the enemy’s
lines before they attack. A very short experience of
fighting a cavalry brigade shows this conclusively,
and both sides will learn to drop their guns’ trails at
a favourable opportunity and move their squadrons
away from them or, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versa</i>, the guns moving
from the squadrons. The latter may be an excellent
plan, and it certainly entails less wear and tear on the
squadrons. Directly the guns come into action the
horses can rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<div id="i_II" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.5625em;">
  <img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="377" height="468" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram II.</span></div></div>

<p>The choice between the two will usually be
dictated by the ground; and in most cases there
will be a combination of the two. Thus a brigade is
advancing towards a crest, the brigadier ahead. He
sends his guns away to the high ground on one
flank, and his squadrons over or round the ridge and
down to the level ground on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
9. <i>When both Forces get away from their Guns.</i>&mdash;Both
sides will usually drop the trails on the same,
say, the west side, and move eastwards, opposite to
each other, to attack. If working along a ridge,
both sides will usually keep their guns on the higher
ground.</p>

<p>Other things being equal, the squadrons which move
farthest, fastest, and in the best order will have an
advantage&mdash;(1) because they will put the enemy’s
squadrons between themselves and the enemy’s gun
fire; (2) because they will compel the enemy’s
squadrons to form so that they are fired on by
artillery and very probably enfiladed.</p>

<p>It becomes obvious, then, that if these tactics are
adopted, and the squadrons of both sides act in
exactly the same way, they will meet on perfectly
level terms.</p>

<p>10. <i>Formations for moving to a Flank.</i>&mdash;The point
then to aim at is to bring some deciding factor in the
attack. In what formation is it best to move the
squadrons away to the flank?</p>

<p>11. <i>Column of Regimental Masses compared with
Column of Squadrons.</i>&mdash;Let us compare column of
regimental mass with column of squadrons, and let
the pace be a trot. Allow thirty seconds for the
shoulder of a regimental mass, five seconds for the
wheel of troops. At the end of four minutes the head
of the mass will have gone 820 yards; the head of
the column 920 yards. But if there are twelve
squadrons, with a front of 64 yards, nine intervals of
8 yards, and two of 16 yards, the last squadron will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
have only gone 50 yards; while in the mass the
rear squadron will have gone 630 yards. It follows,
then, that the leader who adopted column of
regimental masses practically has all his squadrons
within reach of his voice, and they have moved well
away from his guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
12. <i>Relative Effect of Artillery Fire on the two
Formations.</i>&mdash;The relative effect of the guns on the
two columns may be compared. For four minutes the
column of squadrons affords, before it gets on the
move, a stationary though every moment decreasing
mark. After that the target might be taken where
the column has to pass some tree or house, and each
squadron saluted in succession as it reaches this
place. Otherwise it is not a very easy mark, and
certainly not such a large mark as column of regimental
masses, but the latter moves at once, is easily
hidden, and can more easily change pace and
direction.</p>

<p>13. <i>Column of Masses preferred.</i>&mdash;On the whole,
the column of squadrons formation compares unfavourably
with the mass formation, not only as a means
of moving rapidly to a flank, but also for facility of
evolution when arrived there.</p>

<p>14. <i>The Formation for the Attack.</i>&mdash;If, then, we
take mass as the best formation, in what mode shall we
move our mass, and evolve our lines of attack from it?</p>

<p>We will compare two methods. One, ours, being
the echelon attack from mass to a flank, and the
other, the enemy’s, being an attack to the right
from quarter column. Ours only involves sufficient
distance being taken between regimental masses, and
we are ready to attack at once. Theirs involves the
formation of lines of squadron columns and then lines,
and must commence at such a distance from the
enemy as to allow for the time and space used up in
these two formations. For our echelon attack little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
or no ground is consumed in the direction of the
enemy; and this means late formation. Consequently
our mass can go on moving away from the
guns for a longer period.</p>

<div id="i_IV" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.125em;">
  <img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="354" height="403" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram IV.</span></div></div>

<p>Another great point, directly we see him begin to
open to squadron column we can give one more
change to our direction, and so gain his flank. He
will either be taken at an angle, or have to shoulder
his line of squadron columns. Thus we have gained
the outside; he must mask his own guns, and must
be taken in flank by ours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
15. <i>Time for Horse Artillery to unlimber.</i>&mdash;It
would appear as though the leader who first dropped
his guns’ trails would be likely to win; but there is
a saving clause to this. If the other side see the
trails dropped in an obviously good position, they
will avoid the combat there, or perhaps leave a
section or portion of their horse artillery to deal
with these guns, and take the remainder with them
to the flank. They will avoid the cavalry combat
till they are well away from the enemy’s guns, and
will then fight, when they have guns and cavalry,
against cavalry alone. This shows that in the
cavalry combat it is a very difficult matter to know
just when to drop the trails, and get away to a flank
and attack. It must come as an inspiration, something
like Wellington’s move at Salamanca.</p>

<p>16. <i>Form of Attack must be simple.</i>&mdash;To have to
decide between a great many complicated forms of
attack is out of the question. The form of attack
must be simple, understood by all, and only the
timing of it can be left to the leader at the supreme
moment.</p>

<p>17. <i>Conclusions.</i>&mdash;Our conclusions, then, are:</p>

<p>1st. That it is always advisable to move diagonally
to an attack coming at us, even with a squadron or
regiment.</p>

<p>2nd. That when we have to consider the combination
of horse artillery and cavalry squadrons in
attack, it is still more necessary.</p>

<p>3rd. That the mode in which we move to a flank
prior to throwing in our squadrons must be carefully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
considered, and the plan adopted which gives us
most squadrons at the critical point, and the handiest
and simplest mode of evolution.</p>

<p>4th. That intervals between squadrons are a
positive evil in an attacking line.</p>

<p>5th. That in an echelon the supporting body must
be near enough to give confidence to the body in
front, far enough to catch the enemy on the turn.</p>

<p>6th. That no squadron must form line till it sees
an enemy before it to charge. Therefore, if, as the
echelon opens out, the squadron leader sees that he
will be beyond the flank, he should not form to the
flank, but should lead round in squadron column and
look for his opportunity.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“Why is it,” asks Ardant du Picq, “so hard to
use cavalry well?” and replies: “Because the rôle is
all movement, all <em>moral</em>; <em>moral</em> and movement so
closely allied, that often the movement alone without
a charge, without physical action of any sort, makes
an enemy retreat, and if that is followed up, causes
his total rout. The latter follows from the rapidity
of cavalry for those who know how to use it.”</p>

<span class="subhead">FIRE ACTION IN TACTICS OF CAVALRY <i>V.</i> CAVALRY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">A very frequent question, also quite a justifiable one
and one which cavalry soldiers must not shirk, but
must on the other hand thoroughly understand and
thresh out in their own minds, both by practical
experiment and theoretical discussion,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> is the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Since cavalry are armed with an excellent
magazine rifle, may they not more easily and
effectually inflict loss and defeat on the enemy’s
cavalry by that means rather than by employing
shock action, with its gambling uncertainty, its
losses in men and horses, its need of intense resolution
or complete absence of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">arrière pensée</i> on the
part of the leader?</p>

<p>Those cavalry soldiers who have had experience
in such affairs, who have thought the matter out and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
thus obtained certain guiding principles, will reply:
“There are certainly many occasions when the
conditions of terrain or the nature of the combat
favour such action. We have only to mention a
rearguard or a running fight and many instances
come to mind at once in the case of those pursued.”</p>

<p>Intricate ground always favours fire action, and in
small affairs, as a sequel to a dash at the flank of an
enemy holding a position on a rough and unrideable
kopje, it is obviously the right course.</p>

<p>Of all these occasions it is our intention to take
full advantage; never to miss an opportunity. At
the same time, practical experience has convinced us
that we must guard against such action being adopted
to the prejudice of shock action in cases where the
latter is of supreme value, and we must also recognize
the “inherent weakness of mounted troops who
attempt to force a decision with fire action without
combining it with shock action.”</p>

<p>In the <cite>Report on the Cavalry Division Training</cite>,
1909, by General Sir D. Haig, we find the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The principles which should determine the choice
between mounted and dismounted action require to be
more thoroughly considered. Small units have been seen
on several occasions to dismount on open ground when
mounted action was the only sound course to adopt. On
the other hand, squadrons have been seen to remain
mounted in enclosed country when under fire at close range
of dismounted men.</p></blockquote>

<p>Further, we feel that the very fact that there are
many more occasions suitable for fire action than for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
shock action must not make us lose sight of this,
namely, that though we may use fire action when we
meet the enemy nine times out of ten, it is on the
tenth occasion, and then because shock action takes
place, that something definite, something which
affects the result of the campaign, is seen to happen.
Therefore we must not let our future leaders be
brought up with distorted views. We have to
recognize that whilst recourse to shock action
demands great resolution, fire action on each successive
occasion at an increased distance is always
the easy course; whilst the former decides battles
and increases our <em>moral</em>, the latter is a sign in many
cases of the leader weakening, temporizing, or waiting
for orders which will never&mdash;and <em>he knows it</em>&mdash;come.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>We desire to face this question squarely, and with
a just appreciation of human nature and its many
weaknesses and failings. Nor do we forget the Arab
proverb that victory is gained not so much by the
numbers killed as by the numbers frightened. It is
in view of this that we adopt certain lines in our
cavalry training.</p>

<p>It appears desirable to give an instance of a case
where shock action is decisive. Imagine two brigades
of cavalry each with their H.A. Battery meeting on
an open plain. Each wishes to get forward. One,
Red, determining to use rifle action only, adopts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
the best formation he can think of, a double echelon
formation with his guns either on the flanks well
drawn back or in the centre. Dismounting, he
prepares to attack. Blue, leaving a fraction of his
force in guns and rifles to hold Red to his ground
(and cavalry will credit how difficult it is for Red to
break off from such an attack), moves round Red’s
flank, out of easy range and at speed, and with the
remainder of his brigade attacks Red’s flank, choosing
the angle at which he will “go in.”</p>

<p>Red has of his own accord rendered his mobile
force to a great extent immobile; he suffers
accordingly. Blue, using gun fire just in advance of
his shock action, rolls Red up.</p>

<p>It is the fact, that the leaders of both sides
instinctively feel that they should not immobilize
their commands, which will lead to “mounted
combats of cavalry forces.” Scores of actual happenings
have convinced those who have been present at
them that there is nothing harder to hit than a
galloping man and horse; further, that if the mark is
men and horses approaching, the fire will be still
less effectual. Whether the men firing are under
shell fire and their own horses are near them,
whether the enemy are armed with a personal
weapon, especially a lance or long rapier, each of
these factors reduces the number of hits in a way
which can only have been seen to be believed.</p>

<p>In the case of Red, their own and the enemy’s
movements are disconcerting and inimical to accuracy
of fire. In the case of Blue, movement every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
moment is conferring increased advantages on him,
and not the least of these liberty of action.</p>

<p>Red, since he must send his horses to some distance
back, takes a long time to mount and move; and
would give opportunities to Blue during his movement.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>As regards the difficulty of hitting a galloping
horseman, the following incident in South Africa may
be of interest. An officer and four good shots, with
their horses close at hand, remained to observe after
the squadron had been withdrawn from a debatable
kopje. Occasionally they took long shots at the
Boers, who in twos and threes rode strung out
across the front, almost out of range. Without any
warning, suddenly about seventy Boers turned and
galloped straight at the kopje. “Fire steadily till I
tell you to mount,” was the order given by the
officer, who then fired at a man in the centre on a
white horse and well in advance. No Boers were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
seen to fall, and with 100 yards start the five raced
back to their squadron. When they came to compare
notes, it was found that all had fired at the
same man on a white horse, at whom some forty
rounds had been discharged. The conclusion arrived
at was that rifle fire is not effective against galloping
individual horsemen, a conclusion which was duly
acted upon.</p>

<p>Cavalry must have space to manœuvre and fight.
Without these, cavalry lose the advantages conferred
on them by mobility, and become at a disadvantage
compared with infantry.</p>

<p>That there are very diverse opinions on the power
of rifle fire against cavalry must be evident from the
fact that instructions so very different in their import
as the following were issued in Mounted Troops’
Manuals shortly after the war in South Africa:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This Memorandum is not meant for cavalry who turn
their backs, but for those who, when they see the enemy
preparing to charge with sabre and lance, will coolly dismount,
form up, and when he gets within reach, pour in
such a withering fire as will in five minutes kill as many
of the enemy as the same enemy with sword and lance
would kill in five hours on active service.”&mdash;Preface to
Lord Dundonald’s <cite>Cavalry Training</cite>, Canada, 1904.</p>

<p>“If an attack of cavalry is imminent, mounted troops
should, if time admits, gallop to cover or enclosed or broken
ground and there repel and retaliate.”&mdash;General Hutton’s
<cite>Mounted Service Manual, Australian Commonwealth</cite>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The method is illustrated on an opposite page and
shows the formation of square, horses inside. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
formation offers a splendid target to H.A. or machine-gun
fire for preparation of the attack which would
undoubtedly be made by cavalry from a direction
at right angles to that fire.</p>

<p>Colonel Henderson, in <cite>Science of War</cite>, page 160,
sums up the situation as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is beyond question that dealing with a dismounted
force, whatever may be the amount of fire with which it is
endowed, shock tactics may play an important part.</p>

<p>The opportunities of effective outflanking and surprise
may possibly be few; but the very fact that the enemy has
both the power and the will to seek out such opportunities
and to charge home is bound to hamper the movements and
to affect the <em>moral</em> of any force of horsemen which depends
on fire alone.</p>

<p>Such a force, even if it could hold on to its position,
would be unable, except under favourable conditions of
ground, to make any forward progress, for directly it
mounted it would be at the mercy of its antagonist,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> and it
would thus be absolutely prevented from bursting through
the hostile cavalry and from acquiring the information
which it is its main object to obtain.</p>

<p>In the valley of the Shenandoah in 1864 the Confederate
squadrons were armed only with rifles, while the
Federals under Sheridan were trained both to fire and
charge. The result is significant. The southerners, though
admirable horsemen, were worsted at every turn, and their
commander had at last to report that his mounted infantry
were absolutely useless against the Union cavalry.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Dismounted Action of Cavalry</span></h3>

<p>Objection is often raised to cavalry practising the
rôle of the infantry attack, and generally with
reason, for, where there is any other better plan for
cavalry, it is obviously wrong for them to dismount,
leave their horses far behind, and immobilize themselves
in order to carry out this form of attack. But
on the other hand, and especially in rearguard affairs,
it is quite possible that a weak rearguard or detached
force well posted in a gorge or other unturnable
position will hold out till such an attack is made.
Then take plenty of cartridges, carry your swords
with you,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> and “go in.” But do not imagine that
this costly mode of attack should be adopted on all
occasions.</p>

<p>It may be taken as a general rule that full value
is not obtained from cavalry who are far distant or
long separated from their horses. In the latest
German cavalry regulations there is an important
modification. It is laid down that the decisive
dismounted action should only be attempted when
the leader is convinced of possessing numerical
superiority, and very rarely over ground giving the
enemy a prepared field of fire. It is fatal, they
say, to commit your forces with numbers insufficient
for success. They further say (para. 452): “Half-hearted
dismounted action contains the germs of
failure”; and evidently disapprove of the view that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
the extent of the rôle of cavalry dismounted should
be delimitated, as there is a tendency to do in our
army by those who expect the cavalryman to protest
if they ask him to dismount, and to argue how far he
should go in attack&mdash;whereas he must be, and will
be, ready to accept any rôle which aids victory.</p>

<p>Prince Kraft’s contribution to the discussion
which followed the war of 1870–71 should be
regarded, by the British army at any rate, as out of
date. He wrote: “A blow is given to the true
spirit of cavalry if a trooper once believes that he
can fight without his horse.” This blow, duly received
by the British cavalry, has proved innocuous;
they have learnt to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reculer pour mieux sauter</i>, with
an additional power, in the form of the rifle, of the
greatest value to them, whilst at the same time they
will retain the tradition that their</p>

<span class="subhead">A CAVALRY BRIGADE IN ACTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">In a cavalry attack the first objects are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. To give the guns a good field of fire against
the enemy’s attacking squadrons for as long as
possible. This thought comes first, and the first
order is accordingly that which puts the horse
artillery in motion.</p>

<p>2. To keep our attacking squadrons from view of
the enemy till the last moment.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>3. To make the line of direction of the cavalry
attack such that it and the line of the artillery fire
meet approximately at right angles on the mass of
the enemy’s squadrons advancing to the attack, as
already explained in the chapter on flank attack.</p>

<p>In order to attain a good field of fire for the guns
it is often worth while to send two squadrons (not
necessarily from the same regiment) to work towards
the enemy <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en bondes</i>, as the French expression is.
For example (see <a href="#i_V">Diagram V</a>.), “A” squadron Carbineers
pushes on half a mile or so (never more than
a mile) and gets into any likely artillery position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<div id="i_V" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_060.jpg" width="384" height="586" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram V.</span></div></div>

<p>“B” squadron Dragoons pushes on past their
inner flank and gets into the next likely position<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
half a mile farther on, and so on, each moving as
soon as, or perhaps a little before, the other dismounts
and gets ready to use rifle fire on all scouting
parties, bodies of the enemy, etc. These parties are
considerably disconcerted in their work by this mode
of advance.</p>

<p>It is a point of honour, that these squadrons
should if possible get up in time for the general
encounter (unless detained as escort to horse artillery,
a very likely contingency for one of them). But this
bounden duty to be up in the fight, if possible, is a
maxim with cavalry, against whom <span class="smcap">Inaction</span> is the
greatest reproach which can be levelled, next to
cowardice, for which it is liable, and justly so, to be
mistaken.</p>

<p>Having thus got a choice of artillery positions,
and having determined the position of the enemy’s
cavalry, our first care is to select the best position
for the horse artillery.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) It must have a good field of fire over the
ground where the encounter is likely to take place.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) We do not want the enemy to locate it;
therefore it may be advantageous to unlimber under
cover and then manhandle the guns up, or down
into action; or it may remain behind cover and
come into action when it is <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à propos</i>. It is quite
possible that in order to bring an effective fire on
the enemy’s squadrons it may have to come into
action on forward slopes.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) It is preferable for the guns to be defiladed
from the enemy’s artillery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
(<i>d</i>) The teams should be near the guns but under
cover.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The escort should be under cover from view,
mounted or ready to mount, prepared to charge
attacking squadrons in flank. Rifle fire against
squadrons, who have nerve enough to charge a
battery of Q.F. guns, is not likely to stop them.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>Whether we take all our squadrons away to a
flank, whether we use one regiment, or wing of a
regiment, as a feint or bait, how far we go to a flank,
in what formation, and the hundred other possibilities,
we must leave to be settled at the time. Only the
broad principles can then be focussed, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Utilize the ground, choosing cover for the
squadrons and good ground to work over.</p>

<p>2. Deceive and bewilder the enemy.</p>

<p>3. Get well away from our own artillery.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Example</span></h3>

<p>i. The regiment or squadrons A&mdash;&mdash;A sent with
the horse artillery (see <a href="#i_VI">Diagram VI</a>.) must not keep
too near it, because the enemy’s horse artillery may
get the range. Nothing shows more decidedly
ignorance of the duties of escort to horse artillery
than that the cavalry should hug or take into
custody their horse artillery.</p>

<div id="i_VI" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.875em;">
  <img src="images/i_064.jpg" width="366" height="536" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram VI.</span></div></div>

<p>ii. It must not mask its own horse artillery fire
against the enemy’s cavalry or upon his guns. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
cavalry officer who masks his own guns by his
clumsiness usually deserves to be shelled by them.</p>

<p>iii. The O.C. of the escorting regiment or
squadrons must use his own judgment as to whether
he can spare one, two, or three squadrons to help the
two attacking regiments in the combat or in the rally.</p>

<p>iv. He must decide whether to be outside or
inside the horse artillery, or in wings both outside
and inside.</p>

<p>v. Often the O.C. the regiment or squadrons
A&mdash;&mdash;A may have to decide if he shall show up as
bait, but in doing so he must, again, never mask the
artillery. He may (in this case) move west to his
left, especially if he thinks Blue cavalry is coming on
and has not seen the regiments C&mdash;&mdash;C and B&mdash;&mdash;B
making their flank movement. But usually the
regiment or squadrons A&mdash;&mdash;A should move up in
this case more to the right, east, as this means that
Blue horse artillery will come into action facing south
and consequently cannot easily change front and pelt
the regiments C&mdash;&mdash;C and B&mdash;&mdash;B.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>As our horse artillery will always if possible come
into action on a hill or on high ground there will be
some hill behind which A&mdash;&mdash;A is able to manœuvre
or to get cover, or to simulate (by showing up in
different places) a larger force than it actually
represents.</p>

<p>The leading of the regiments B&mdash;&mdash;B and C&mdash;&mdash;C<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
will depend on the signals sent from the Brigadier
(who rides wide on the inner flank&mdash;eastern side in
this case&mdash;and where he can see the enemy’s advance)
to the Brigade Major. These regiments B&mdash;&mdash;B and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
C&mdash;&mdash;C should make their move if possible under
cover from view, and at the critical moment the order
to attack should be conveyed to them.</p>

<p>As one of the objects of this manœuvre is to give
our guns a good target, the O.C. horse artillery must
direct his fire on the enemy’s squadrons, in this case,
X&mdash;&mdash;X and Y&mdash;&mdash;Y. The enemy’s artillery, if
already in action, will sustain little harm from his
fire. The result of the encounter will depend on
which side wins the shock action, therefore every
shell which falls in an enemy’s squadron is a help.
The enemy’s supporting squadrons are a special
target, also the enemy’s rallying squadrons.</p>

<p>Let the O.C. horse artillery remember that the
sight and sound of his bursting shells will often
enlighten the Brigadier as to the position of the
enemy’s squadrons and guide him in his attack, on
which everything depends.</p>

<p>Before the combat, <span class="smcap">Resolution</span>, <i>i.e.</i> fixedness of
purpose, the instant adaptation of stratagem to the
features of the terrain, an attack at the psychological
moment galloping knee to knee; in the combat,
constantly keeping a reserve and constantly re-forming
into good order for the next effort,&mdash;these are the
secrets with which to ensure coming successfully out
of a cavalry encounter. “’Tis dogged as does it.”
But do not let the leader imagine that he will
always be making an advance, when this combat
comes off.</p>

<p>Especially to be deprecated is the unreasoning
gallop of squadrons, so commonly seen at manœuvres<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
in an advance towards an enemy, which deprives
them of any value from the reports of officers,
patrols, etc.</p>

<p>If it is evident that the enemy has forestalled our
manœuvre, and that any move to the front will place
our brigade in the jaws of his attack, then, as Von
Bernardi (page 147, <cite>Cavalry in War and Peace</cite>)
says, the “deployment should either be on existing
lines or to the rear, and should be covered by dismounted
action of the advanced guard or by artillery
fire. Only thus can the lost freedom of action be
regained, as superior breadth of deployment is the
first and perhaps the most important step towards
maintenance of the initiative.”</p>

<p>Other cases in which it may be a positive
advantage to allow the enemy some measure of
initiative occur either when you are quite ignorant
of his strength, or when the ground on which your
squadrons stand or in their rear is most suitable for
the combat from your point of view.</p>

<p>In the passage of defiles in the face of an enemy,
say, in the case of a river or swamp, the rule is for
the column, as it emerges from the far end of the
defile, to move in column of troops parallel to the
river or swamp. It will thus (i.) be ready to wheel
into line and attack quickly, (ii.) there is no fear
of the column being pushed back on to succeeding
troops coming through the defile, (iii.) the head of
the defile is kept clear of troops, (iv.) there is one safe
flank for your column, <i>i.e.</i> that on the side of the
swamp or river, and (v.) there is not the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
danger of the enemy pounding<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> an easy mark at
the mouth of the defile with his artillery. If your
own artillery can occupy any ground on this side
of the defile, from which the exit can be seen, the
accompanying diagram shows that a considerable
force of your cavalry can make the passage with
comparative safety under cover of its fire. It should
always be remembered that the attack against troops,
in course of the passage of a defile, will usually take
place when only that proportion has crossed which
the enemy thinks he can beat decisively.</p>

<div id="i_VII" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;">
  <img src="images/i_067.jpg" width="352" height="249" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram VII.</span></div></div>

<p>A word of warning is necessary as regards a common
and most enticing error, which is that of allowing
squadron after squadron to be drawn into a fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
As regards the dissemination of squadrons, this
would not be such a serious matter if every detachment
would return immediately its rôle had been played;
but unfortunately Providence does not appear to
make commanders of detachments like that; if it
did, automatically our force would become, say, one-quarter
stronger.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<span class="subhead">CAVALRY IN THE GENERAL ENGAGEMENT</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“It was thought that to engage the enemy to fight was our
business.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> at Preston.</p>

<p>“The part played varies according to the quality of the instrument
and the capabilities of the operator.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cherfils.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>In the last few years considerable prominence has
been given to the action of independent cavalry, and
there is reason to believe that this might lead to a
large portion of the cavalry of an army being detached
when a general engagement was imminent. This
tendency may well arise where the general officer
commanding has not a complete grasp<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> or perhaps
belief in the possibility of a rôle for cavalry on the
battlefield, nor entire reliance on them for that
assistance, which, if properly trained and directed,
they are well able to give.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
The general officer commanding may, under the
impression that the combat can be carried through
by the artillery and infantry without much further
assistance, order the cavalry commander to take the
bulk of his squadrons and make a detour, involving
half the night spent in the saddle, and thus place
himself on the flank or rear of the enemy, and there
to attack or wait his opportunity in the event of the
enemy’s defeat.</p>

<p>Acting in accordance with these orders, we may
picture the cavalry arrived at a point some twelve
or fifteen miles away, where the leader may very well
find it is by no means all plain sailing. His progress
may be blocked at some bridge or defile, and, whilst
he is endeavouring to push aside the opposition,
reinforcements, including artillery, come upon the
scene, and he finds that to avoid heavy loss he must
draw off the larger portion of his force in order to
make a still longer detour. This wastes several hours
and results in a drawn fight, or, if he does get nearer
to his objective, he finds that, with timely warning
given, the enemy are well able to hold him off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Meanwhile the flank left open, or practically denuded
of mobile troops, has every chance of being
turned; all the tendency of modern fighting is
towards extension and dispersion, whilst the desperate
counter-attack is the theme of every writer. We
can imagine no more galling occurrence than a
counter-attack,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> thrust in on one’s own flank (more
probably than not, the very flank from which the
cavalry have been sent), and, in their absence, carried
through with decisive results. These wide turning
movements, or rather action against the flank and
rear of the enemy, are in the nature of putting all
one’s eggs in one basket, and not infrequently taking
it for granted that the enemy will not stand his
ground.</p>

<p>It has been very well said that cavalry is an arm
of opportunity, and opportunities are most likely to
occur where actual fighting is going on. Against
the Boers, who had no idea of counter-attack, these
turning movements came off; against well-led troops,
suitably disposed in depth,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> and avoiding wide dispersion,
their success is very doubtful.</p>

<p>Napoleon said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>Cavalry charges were good at the beginning, during the
course of, and at the end of a battle. They should always
be made, if possible, on the flanks of infantry, especially
when this last is engaged in front.&mdash;Napoleon’s Maxim,
No. 50.</p></blockquote>

<p>He would no doubt go further now and speak of
the intervention of cavalry with horse artillery and
machine guns as likely to turn the scale in the crisis
of battle.</p>

<p>But Napoleon would recognize that it is by rapidly
prolonging their own flank against being turned,
or by enveloping or enfilading the enemy’s line by
participation in the counter-attack, or by work such
as that done by the German horse artillery and
cavalry at Loigny-Poupry on December 2, 1870
(late in the war when the German cavalry had learnt
their lesson), that cavalry show to advantage. There
2150 German sabres and 24 guns, acting in combination,
first dashed aside the opposition offered by
the French in villages on the left flank of their line
of battle, and then, sweeping round, proceeded to
threaten and shell the left rear of the French infantry
line&mdash;good work, and showing the value of mobile
forces boldly thrown at a flank, but lacking in the
final stage in that resolute determination which gives
full value to such a movement, and this, no doubt,
because they had not been trained in peace to act
together.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>This leads one to consider what was the training<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
of our own cavalry subsequent to 1870. Was it not
the general tendency of our authorities and tactical
experts to discredit the action of cavalry on the battlefield,
without considering whether the armament,
organization, and previous training of the cavalry
of both France and Germany were such as to lead
to success?</p>

<p>These points all influenced the course of the
actions in the first months of the 1870 war in the
most remarkable manner. Again, was the leading,
except for a few bright exceptions, satisfactory?
French and German writers on cavalry plainly intimate
that the direction of cavalry enterprise by the
higher leaders, and the action of the cavalry leaders,
were distinctly disappointing.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>Meantime a belief gained from the American War
that dismounted tactics were the solution to the
cavalry question obsessed some, as it always will
those who lack (i.) a practical knowledge of the arm,
(ii.) imagination, (iii.) an acquaintance with military
history, though the most acute thinker of that time,
Henderson, lays down very concisely in <cite>Science of
War</cite>, p. 60, “that mounted infantry were absolutely
worthless against cavalry.”</p>

<p>In peace, as the value of the bullet rose, the use
of cavalry fell in the mind of the man of theory.
Probably only the few, who with an open mind
thoroughly tested the two rival lines of action in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
field, and on every kind of ground, were able to give
a correct appreciation. But these never swerved
from the opinion that mounted men relying only on
the rifle were hopeless in attack or in the open against
cavalry, but were, on the other hand, of great value
in defence, or in broken ground, or in retreat, and
further, that many small opportunities, far more than
for shock action, would be offered to them, which cunning
and versatility would enable them to profit by.</p>

<p>But all this talk had not been without its effect,
and the result was that it was not considered
ridiculous that a large force of mounted men should
be frittered away in ineffective dismounted action,
sitting all day on a hill or ridge, and firing at great
distances at an equally sticky enemy. Such action is
a slur on cavalry for whom “Action and again action”
is the motto.</p>

<p>If both cavalries work on this principle, and this
was often the case both in the early portion of the
South African War<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> and in the Manchurian campaign,
certainly no important combats will take place;
but, directly one side begins to “push,” mounted
combats will result, and as each side finds that the
greatest number of squadrons, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ceteris paribus</i>, wins,
there will be great combats of masses, and a “fight to
a finish” amongst the cavalry on the flank of the
great general encounter.</p>

<p>As we have said, in the South African War during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the first year, with few exceptions, fire at long distances
and infinitely wearisome tactics were the rule;
it was only in the last year of the war that the
British cavalry, colonials, and mounted infantry&mdash;their
attack in some cases supported by really
effective and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à propos</i> artillery and machine-gun
fire&mdash;began to push and gallop at the Boers at every
opportunity. Then the Boers always galloped away,
but gradually they, too, learnt from us the value of
pushing, and Botha, Delarey, and others executed
some good charges with marked effect, but they
never attempted, and wisely so, to charge men armed
with swords. That was too much for the cavalry
soldier to hope for.</p>

<p>In the Manchurian War the Japanese, with their
small force of cavalry, wisely played the defensive
game; the Russians,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> trained and organized for
twenty years on wrong principles, and led without
much attempt at reasoned dash or enterprise, seldom
imposed their will on the enemy, or made any effort
to push in with their numerous squadrons and sotnias<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
on an open flank. If there was an exception it was
when, before the battle of Mukden, a force of Cossacks
under General Liubarin attacked the Japanese
right flank in the mountains, and are stated to have
“rendered the situation critical” till driven off by
mixed forces of infantry and cavalry. This is given
as one of the few cavalry lessons of the Manchurian
War. The Russian cavalry officer had not received
sufficient training in grand tactics, nor does the combined
action of their horse artillery with cavalry
appear to have been in any respect effective.</p>

<p>The lesson for our cavalry from these two wars
appears to be, that we should teach our officers to
think about something bigger than the tactics of a
squadron or regiment, to learn <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit d’armée</i>, to
remember that a few independent squadrons cut up
rarely influence a war, whereas in every big combat
the result (and that result may be affected largely
by the leading of a few squadrons) is a national
matter. And there always recurs the most supreme
question for the cavalry leader of masses on the battlefield,
whether, apart from the cases in which a sacrifice
is necessary, the anticipated results are in any way
proportionate with the stake. Even the riding down
of an infantry brigade will not always compensate
for the expenditure of a cavalry division.</p>

<p>Langlois pictures “cavalry with its light batteries
in the decisive attack moving by ways which are
hidden from view and fire ... falling on the enemy
in mass and surprising him. Reconstructing his (the
enemy’s) defences, and keeping hostile troops at a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
distance, measures which,” he says, “require a short
dismounted fight, then part of the cavalry advance
and harass and prevent the enemy returning, whilst
the rest holds the position with fire. The infantry
will follow the cavalry as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>There is no more important subject of training for
the cavalry officer than cavalry action on the battlefield
of all arms. Theoretical study is not enough, it
is absolutely necessary to study in the field with
troops or flags representing troops. Since cavalry
action is almost invariably<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> on the flanks, staff rides,
cavalry instructional rides, manœuvres, and other
exercises can commence by dealing with only one
flank, thus half the number of men, flags, etc., will
suffice.</p>

<p>The director should never permit one side to know
the strength in any arm on the other side; this is
desirable, if only to increase the difficulty and value
of gaining information by reconnaissance in these
exercises. For this purpose a proportion of cavalry-scouting
parties should be detailed. Too much stress
can scarcely be laid on this essential of training.
Cavalry can now simulate infantry, smokeless powder
renders it impossible to judge the volume of fire,
every bit of information has to be fought for, and
will cost the lives of both horses and men. Even the
boldest and most cunning scouting, without fighting,
will not lead to any certain information; it is “peacetime
talk” to imagine that it will be otherwise.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Having this in view, the director should lay the
greatest stress on dash and enterprise as opposed to
stickiness and a desire to do nothing or await further
report. It is at these exercises that the director can
go far to establish a <em>doctrine</em>, that of the resolute
offensive.</p>

<p>If officers cannot act with dash in field manœuvres,
how can they be expected to do so in war? Ground
gained in peace manœuvres matters little, but in
war a position gained on the flank of an army by
a cavalry brigade may now mean the enfilading by
horse artillery of entrenched infantry for three miles
in extent.</p>

<p>A very good plan is to take some well-known
battle and lay out the situation with flags at some
portion of the day, and then work out the cavalry
action in theory and practice. This will admit of
considerable variation. To lay out fresh battlefields
or inaugurate new general ideas each time leads to
waste of time in preliminary study of the situation.
There is not the slightest doubt that the want of
this very practical study has affected the leading
of cavalry in the past in a marked degree.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> Want
of determination comes from want of knowledge of
what to do in the situation. In the past, sticky
leading has been condoned because few knew any
better. Long ago Lewal wrote prophetically of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
bad effect on cavalry of “being umpired out of action
at peace manœuvres, and told of smokeless powder and
magazine rifles” (Lewal, p. 62).</p>

<p>It is all very well to say that every hill should be
regarded as being held by the enemy till you know
otherwise, but let us take care to know one way or
other without delay, and not to imagine that there
is any great value or safety in being on a hill. Hills
may be well shelled by the enemy’s horse artillery,
whilst his cavalry gallop up to the dead ground
to be found in front and flank of nine hills out
of ten, where, if supported by horse artillery fire,
it is better placed than the dismounted men on the
hill.</p>

<p>Finally our leaders, after preparing themselves,
their staffs, and subordinate leaders by constant
practice, “must ever remember and must impress on
their subordinates that hesitation and delay handicap
operations far more heavily than do mere mistakes
in choice of methods.”&mdash;<cite>German Cavalry Training</cite>,
para. 399.</p>

<p>That the risks which one side takes paralyses the
action of the other has been true of every battle.
There is (and peace-time theorists on the military
art often neglect this fact) a first idea or instinct in
the minds of the majority of the human race, that
the man or animal dashing straight at them has some
good reason to believe that he can, and will, hurt
them; this primary instinct leads them to subordinate
themselves to the initiative of the other. Watch the
unreasoning game of chase and check between a cat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
and a dog, and you have a good example of much that
happens, and will always happen, on a battlefield.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>“Initiative is the greatest virtue in a leader; to
avoid dissipation of force is a well-proved means
of victory.”&mdash;<cite>German Cavalry Training</cite>, para. 407.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Conclusions</span></h3>

<p>1. There are risks of doubtful value in action
directed on wide lines against the enemy’s flank and
rear.</p>

<p>2. The 1870 and American Wars confused the
issues and led in some cases to sticky action by
cavalry on South African battlefields.</p>

<p>3. In Manchuria the Japanese adopted correct
tactics in view of Russian want of enterprise and
their own want of cavalry. The rôle of the weaker
cavalry was exemplified in some respects.</p>

<p>4. Push on the part of one side will compel the
other to bring up more squadrons and lead to the
fight of cavalry masses.</p>

<p>5. It is only by special training that cavalry
leaders can learn their duties in a general engagement.</p>

<p>6. Much depends on the leader’s initiative, whilst
this again depends on his knowledge gained by
previous practice in similar circumstances.</p>

<p>There are those who ask, “But where are the
Ziethen and Seydlitz cavalry charges nowadays?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Let them call to mind, for it is instructive to do so,
the combination of circumstances, and, be it noted,
circumstances which may well rise again, which
conduced to the success of the cavalry of Frederick the
Great.</p>

<p>I. A king general, who had a taste for and
knowledge of training cavalry.</p>

<p>II. A training of all ranks suited to the war about
to be undertaken.</p>

<p>III. A cavalry with picked leaders quite unencumbered
by officers past or unsuited to their work.</p>

<p>IV. Horses well conditioned under the eye of an
autocrat, who had the common sense to demand and
see that he got, not fat, but fit horses.</p>

<p>V. A skilled direction of the cavalry on the battlefield
by a cool and intensely determined generalissimo,
such as Frederick the Great undoubtedly was.</p>

<p>Now let us, on the other hand, state the case in
the South African operations of 1899–1902. (In
almost the same words as regards some paragraphs
as were used in 1897.)</p>

<p>I. An unskilled training and inspection of cavalry
in the large proportion of cases, often conducted by
officers of other arms, and such as tended to inspire
all ranks with a desire for display and fine appearance
on parade, rather than with a whole-souled yearning
for efficiency for the war in hand.</p>

<p>II. The training of cavalry regiments in small, flat
twelve-acre drill-fields walled in from the slums
of a city, in which cavalry were still stationed for
hopelessly out-of-date political reasons. What real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
cavalry training was possible along the tram lines and
between rows of suburban villas?</p>

<p>III. A personnel too largely drawn from towns, and
ignorant of the exigencies of campaigning horse-management.</p>

<p>IV. Horses, three-quarters bred, of fair pace and
condition, but the latter necessary qualification for a
campaign entirely spoiled in most cases by, say, a
thirty days’ voyage, followed by a five or six days’
railway journey, then semi-starvation at the end of a
line of communication, then some quick work followed
by two or three days’ total starvation, then more
work, and so on. Constantly our strategy outran our
supply arrangements and the condition of our horses.</p>

<p>V. An enemy fighting in their own country, and
each man owning two or three hardy, well-conditioned
country-breds.</p>

<p>VI. Tactics of the enemy; to hold on to a position
with rifle fire, and when seriously attacked or their
flanks turned to disperse at a gallop.</p>

<p>Tactics all very well in their way, and just as
disconcerting and annoying to our squadrons as they
were to Murat’s cavalry in the advance into Russia;
but these Parthian tactics are only suited to a limited
number of strategical phases, a point difficult to
bring home to the mind of those who have not
studied strategy. They were tactics which resulted
in a loss to the Boers of about 5000 men, generally
foot people, at Paardeberg and, later, another 5000 in
the Wittebergen. Meanwhile the cavalry to which
they were opposed was able, by simple turning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
movements, to afford the main column, a practically
uninterrupted advance from the Orange River to the
Portuguese border.</p>

<p>It is strange, indeed, how the lesson of those
operations has in many cases been read upside down
by a nation which takes no steps to study military
history, and which, consequently, forgets that the
spirit of vigorous offensive, which did and must result
in occasional heavy loss, had been sternly discountenanced
by the majority of their press, after
the experiences of Black Monday. “Conduct the
operations without loss, or, better, by diplomacy&mdash;and
above all with kindness,” was then the cry.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pursuit</span></h3>

<p>One of the great fallacies, and one to which in
England especially we are victims, is that war can
be conducted on haphazard principles by the instinct
of brave men.</p>

<p>Not only do these brave men “let us in,” on every
possible occasion (especially when they are so brave
and foolish as to neglect proper precautions), but they
forget that the sole thing in war is to “get there,”
that is, to bring the enemy to his knees and win.</p>

<p>One of their failings, and it is a typical British
failing, is the neglect to pursue, or, if they pursue,
they neglect to do so properly. Again, and again, in
the early part of the operations in South Africa was
this neglected. The first good instance of pursuit,
conducted on proper principles, was that carried out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
by General French, and resulting in the ultimate
surrender of Cronje. Why was this on the right
principle? The answer is, “Because it was conducted
on the principle of “the parallel pursuit,” and resulted
in intercepting Cronje at a crossing of the Modder
River.”</p>

<p>It is in such matters that the professional has the
advantage of the amateur; the latter would, no doubt,
see no reason why a pursuit should do otherwise than
follow in the tracks of the enemy, forgetting that
there he will find the best and freshest troops, with
good supplies of ammunition, and under the best
leaders,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> their orders may probably be, “To stop and
die.” Again, that along this line he will run his head
against positions, hastily prepared no doubt, but still
positions, which are meant to delay pursuit. The
whole proceeding would be analogous to trying to
beat the enemy at chess by taking piece after piece
till only the king was left.</p>

<p>Compare with this the “parallel pursuit.” Sufficient
troops are pushing the enemy’s rearguard and lulling
his main force to a fancied security; then the
cavalry leader moves several miles to the flank of the
direction taken by the enemy with as much speed as
possible, since there is nothing to delay him, and he
goes on till there is some obstacle, perhaps some
defile, which the enemy must cross; here he throws
himself boldly in the way of the enemy, of whom
those who have led the stampede, the weakest and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
least courageous, will be in front. Ten to one some
of these will surrender, unable to bear up against this
fresh disaster, and may be used to assist to block the
defile, and thus affect the <em>moral</em> of those who are
following, and who are, perhaps, in better order.</p>

<p>To the minds of leaders of the stamp of Napoleon’s
marshals this form of pursuit was ever present, and
we come on instances of it.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> It is essentially a duty
of cavalry and horse artillery.</p>

<p>That it often requires strong determination on the
part of the leader to urge tired men and horses to
pursue is well known. After the battle of Katzbach,
Blücher had pressed his cavalry to pursue, but these
made a very weak attempt at pursuit, blaming the
weather and alleging extreme fatigue. Blücher
summed up the situation of cavalry as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The State can afford to lose a few hundred horses in
order to make a victory complete, or when it is a question
of the annihilation of the enemy’s entire army. To neglect
to obtain the full results of a victorious battle is inevitably
to oblige yourself sooner or later to gamble again.</p></blockquote>

<span class="subhead">THE DISPOSITION OF CAVALRY IN A CAMPAIGN</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="FIRST_PART">FIRST PART</h3>

<p class="in0">It is related that its owner tried as an experiment to
find out what was the smallest amount on which a
horse could work. When he had reduced the animal
to one straw per diem, the experiment ceased, as the
horse died.</p>

<p>The reader, constantly bearing in mind the above
anecdote (since, if great generals have overlooked in
the past the moral of the tale, there is no reason why
others should not do so in future), may proceed to
the subject of this chapter, but not without the
recurrent thought, that, however dashing the conception
of the use of cavalry in a campaign, this one
point must be foremost. What will the cavalry
horses live on? Horses cannot live on nothing.
Few survive if put for a prolonged period on ½-grain
rations and no hay or grazing, if such is followed by
work.</p>

<p>How far motor vehicles carrying supplies have
changed the aspect of affairs in regard to this question
is at present a moot point. Undoubtedly the effect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
of the domination of the air by man has materially
affected the question of obtaining information.</p>

<p>The principle, “that an army should place in its
front the whole of its available cavalry forces from
the very beginning of a campaign,” to some extent
arises from the desirability of an undisturbed concentration
for one’s own army, and also the advantage
of checking that of the enemy.</p>

<p>Next in order will be the desire of the commander-in-chief
of the army to have definite information of
the enemy’s movements whilst at the same time his
own movements are covered. This will enable him
to direct the movements of his army, whilst still at
a distance from the enemy’s advanced guards, and
effect concentration for battle neither too soon nor
too late (since both of these contingencies entail
grave inconveniences), but at the right moment.</p>

<p>But when it comes to practical politics, it is plain,
and must be regarded as a principle, that a cavalry
brigade, division or corps cannot be relied upon to
perform efficiently the duties of policeman and
detective at one and the same time. The duty of
the latter would carry the former away from his
beat.</p>

<p>The French cavalry in 1870, though they possessed
what Ardant du Picq describes as the true “Casse
cou”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> readiness to charge (and by the bye, that <em>is</em> a
portion of the <em>cavalry spirit</em>), almost entirely lacked
skilled direction by the higher leaders. This fault<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
was no doubt due, in some degree, to the three arms
training each in separate water-tight compartments,
and not on a large and comprehensive scale in peace,
precisely as Langlois says of us in reference to our
army’s work in South Africa: “The English took no
steps in peace to create and strengthen any union
between the arms, and evil overtook them.”</p>

<p>Direction by the higher leaders will always be
lacking, where those leaders, in peace time, are unable
to divorce themselves from the surroundings and
prejudices of their own particular arm, whatever it
may be, and to enter whole-heartedly and unreservedly
into the spirit of the Napoleonic maxim
(No. 47): “Infantry, cavalry, and artillery <em>are
nothing without each other</em>.”</p>

<p>Be that as it may, after the 1870–71 war the
French cavalry had a moving spirit in General
Galliffet, and he was well supported by some of the
cleverest French military writers. They dissected
French and German cavalry action in 1870–71 (and
that of cavalry in other wars), laying bare the
mistakes and failures of the cavalry of both armies.
They saw what was wanted, higher direction and co-ordination
of the work of cavalry, so that the two
functions of cavalry, information and security (prior
to its rôle on the battlefield), might be realized to
their full extent. Their deduction from the
campaigns of the Napoleonic period was, that that
great leader and organizer had discerned the impossibility
of co-ordinating these duties; that in his
earlier campaigns there were two great units of war,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
the cavalry of army corps and a corps of reserve
cavalry;<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> the latter was composed of numerous
light cavalry, acting about a day in front of the
columns of the main body. Again, that in 1812,
corresponding with the formation of groups of
armies, the corps of cavalry was created to act
independently, in advance of the general movement
of the armies, making a third great unit. They
arrived at the conclusion that war brings into play
three great units, each of which requires its special
cavalry.</p>

<p>1. In front of armies under the generalissimo an
independent cavalry, in one or more bodies, to insure
liberty of offensive action to the generalissimo.</p>

<p>2. In each army a division of cavalry to ensure to
it the liberty of defensive action by giving time to
concentrate and take up favourable positions.</p>

<p>3. In each army corps a regiment or half-regiment
to ensure tranquillity and freedom from surprise.</p>

<p>Nor did they fail to bring to notice that Napoleon’s
system was to find a cavalry leader, and let him
organize his cavalry to help the plan of campaign,
and not to waste his cavalry in a sort of insurance
policy.</p>

<p>The essence of cavalry is offence, “offensive
résolue, offensive quand même offensive à outrance,
qui fut le plus souvent la seule règle de tactique,”
not defence and shepherding infantry divisions;<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
latter work does not demand the most highly trained
cavalry.</p>

<p>By these steps gradually the principle, which is
clearly stated in our F.S. Regulations, was arrived
at, viz.:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The main force of cavalry will usually be organized
in one or more cavalry divisions, and retained as the
instrument of strategical reconnaissance under the immediate
orders of the commander-in-chief.&mdash;Part II., British F.S.R.,
1909, p. 25.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the present date the French, German, and
Austrian organization is practically identical in this
respect. All recognize that “we must fight to
reconnoitre, and fight to screen.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>The rôle of cavalry, as defined at p. 182 of the
French <cite>Service de la Cavalerie</cite>, 1909, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. <i>The Cavalry of Exploration</i> (answering to our own
independent cavalry), the personal agent of the generalissimo,
is sent where he wishes, in quest of the news he desires.
This news the leader of this cavalry must send in good
time; his independence is limited to the means he employs
to get news. The cavalry of exploration may also be sent
on special missions against the columns or convoys of the
enemy, and ought, <em>whilst observing its instructions and
carrying out its</em> important rôle, to seize any opportunity of
destroying the enemy’s cavalry.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Cavalry is the arm, above all, of surprise, and consequently
may often obtain the greatest results by a sudden
attack on the wings or rear of the adversary.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Cavalry of the Army Corps</i> (answering to our
protective cavalry) and the divisional cavalry find out and
inform their commander what is happening in the zone
allotted to them.</p>

<p>They must keep off the enemy’s cavalry, guard the
columns against surprise, cover their deployment, and seek
every opportunity of intervening with effect in the combat.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Divisional Cavalry</i> may, in the combat, be the
only troops on whom the divisional general can depend for
safety from surprise: their commander must, accordingly,
not only seek opportunities to use the bulk of his troops
opportunely in the combat, but also give information and
guard the division against surprise on its flanks and rear.</p></blockquote>

<p>What use, then, does the generalissimo make of his
independent cavalry? He sends it forward to tear
the veil from his adversary’s armies; whilst thus
engaged it may, in fact almost certainly will, meet
the enemy’s independent cavalry similarly employed,
when, with a view to carrying out its orders, it will
probably be compelled to fight&mdash;to fight for information.</p>

<p>Let us suppose it successful and the squadrons of the
enemy’s independent cavalry dispersed, unable to face
their adversary. Our independent cavalry push on to
the enemy and meet the screen of cavalry, the service
of security which covers his army. This again they
must tear aside, and lay bare the heads of the enemy’s
infantry columns. Even then their mission is not
complete; they must direct their energies against the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
flanks of the enemy’s columns and demoralize them.
It is plain, then, that on the successful action of
the independent cavalry great issues may depend.</p>

<p>With regard to the movement of these forces,
whenever cavalry are moving in the direction of an
enemy (whether they are the independent cavalry or
the protective cavalry), it is obvious that they will
endeavour to pass quickly through ground which is
for any reason unfavourable to them and advantageous
to the enemy for attack, whilst they will dwell in
positions which present obvious advantages to them.
The result is, that from large forces of cavalry
down to the smallest unit there is a tendency to
move forward in bounds.</p>

<p>The protective cavalry will further be influenced
by the desire to forestall the enemy in gaining
positions for the infantry columns following them,
and in taking up for the night a line of outposts on
some natural obstacle, which will give them some
security whilst they are halted.</p>

<p>It is quite a debatable question whether the
evolution of cavalry into three classes as at present
is not largely due to the arming of cavalry with a
good rifle, and to rendering them consequently able
to protect themselves, and able to turn out small
parties of the enemy who hold defiles, railway
stations, etc., against them. The new German
Cavalry Regulations, para. 391, state: “Thus
cavalry, owing to its great adaptability, is capable
of independent action in practically every eventuality
of the battlefield.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
In any case horse artillery, machine guns, and the
rifle have added enormously to the defensive power
of cavalry; when, therefore, the protective cavalry
are thrown back on the infantry, by the enterprise
of the enemy’s independent squadrons, the latter may
lightly, and without warning, find themselves attacking
infantry in position, by mistake for dismounted
cavalry, and consequently suffer very severely.
Not only that, but the mixed detachments of all
arms likely to be met with at this juncture, possess
a power and length of resistance, which our cavalry
may perhaps successfully simulate, and thus hold
back and delay the advance of the enemy’s cavalry.</p>

national strategy and tactics; for only such teaching can be of real
service to his country.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Von der Goltz</span>, <cite>Nation in Arms</cite>, p. 143.</p></blockquote>

<p>Instead of labouring the point as to the rôle of
cavalry under these circumstances, perhaps one may
be permitted to recall to the reader’s mind that,
unless we go back to Napoleonic precedent, there
are no actual experiences in modern times of the
effect to be obtained by using cavalry in the manner
prescribed at present. The whole is pure theory, but
we can say from our own experience that the protective
cavalry may fail if they attempt to be strong
everywhere on the old “pepper-box” system.</p>

<p>The drives in South Africa, in which we were
strong nowhere and weak everywhere, proved, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
indeed was expected, that a strong and determined
enemy can always break through the long weak line
unless the latter follows the line of some serious
obstacle.</p>

<p>It is also a matter of easy demonstration and
universal agreement that the cavalry which dominates
in the first great cavalry struggle has already gained
an enormous advantage for its side.</p>

<p>What is the logical outcome? It is, that unless
(1) our cavalry force is redundant, or (2) there are
difficulties in feeding our independent cavalry, or
(3) the enemy’s cavalry is very weak, or (4) our
cavalry comprises squadrons, which we cannot, from
reasons of want of training or armament, oppose to
the enemy’s cavalry, we shall see every available
squadron taken from the protective cavalry and
handed over to the independent cavalry. Intelligence
comes before security.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> Meanwhile the protective
rôle will be carried out by divisional mounted
troops, cyclists, and infantry detachments (see sec. 92,
F.S.R.).</p>

<p><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ceteris paribus</i>, the first advantage will be with
the side which can put the greatest number of
squadrons into the corps of independent cavalry,
and, in view of this, a fact plainly spoken of and
counted upon in all strategical conceptions of future
campaigns on the Continent, the preponderance of
well-trained squadrons is clearly the object to be
aimed at.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the ideas which are promulgated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
as to the rôle for the weaker cavalry, by which
a cavalry, worse trained, worse armed, and proportionately
less in numbers will compensate for these
shortcomings by superior tactics, are purely Utopian.
This “fond thing vainly invented” may interest or
beguile the mind of the unfortunate tax-payer, but
does not belong to the regions of plain military
common sense, which, in its preparation for war, has
no place for chance work, and must have no weak
link in the chain.</p>

<p>Let those with whom the wish is master of the
thought read General von Bernardi’s most recent
statement in <cite>Cavalry in Peace and War</cite>, p. 356,
where speaking of the German force of trained
cavalry, enormous as it already is, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have repeatedly stated that I consider our cavalry to
be of itself too weak. The more I study modern warfare,
the more convinced do I feel that the value of the arm,
when handled according to modern ideas, has increased.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us remember that cavalry cannot be improvised,
and that even squadrons of the best class
of mounted rifles, formed entirely of natural horsemen
and fairly good shots, are very heavily penalized,
apart from their armament and training, unless they
have professional brigade, regimental, and squadron
leaders, and know how to work with horse artillery.
They cannot be expected to face trained and
properly organized cavalry brigades on anything like
equal terms. At the same time, if reliance is placed
on numbers, one is at once faced (i.) by the forage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
supply and its carriage, (ii.) by the enormous item of
expense in remounting, already referred to in the
chapter on “The horse.”</p>

<p>The outcome is that one arrives at this plain and
simple proposition.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> Only the most highly trained
cavalry soldier is worth a horse and food for his
horse when a nation is engaged against an enemy of
modern continental type. This point is undoubtedly
grasped on the Continent, where the proposal to use
cyclists as a reserve of riflemen with cavalry is
generally accepted.</p>

<p>Every one, practically, can now ride and look after
a bicycle, and given passable roads, cyclists can
travel farther and faster than horses, and carry more
days’ reserve rations. In war in a civilized and well-roaded
country they cannot fail to be a most useful
adjunct to cavalry: (1) as a reserve of rifles, (2) as
despatch-riders, (3) as an accessory in outpost and
reconnoitring duty.</p>

<p>It is not the scheme of this book to enter into the
question of training other than regular cavalry, nor
to enter into any discussion as to the precise value
in war of hastily raised mounted troops; since in
doing so one might say something which had the
appearance of discouraging the volunteer; whereas
there is no question that the spirit, which animated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
for instance those yeomanry and colonial troops who
came out early in the operations in South Africa,
1899–1902, is a great national and imperial asset.</p>

<p>At the same time it is right to make it perfectly
plain that the non-professional cavalry soldier
has an exceedingly hard task before him, and one
requiring very exceptional qualities such as are not
usually found in those who do not possess the initial
asset of being constantly in the saddle and out in
the open. Even these must find it extremely
difficult to train to anything but a very mediocre
standard, unless they possess (i.) sufficient leisure
to prepare themselves amidst the surroundings of
regular troops, and (ii.) the large amount of patriotism
and right feeling which induces a man voluntarily
to place himself under and endure the irksome
restraints of discipline.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Ten times more does this
apply to the officer; purely amateur officers are
poison (the virus being in direct proportion to their
rank), and entirely out of place in war. To imagine
that it is patriotism to wait till war begins, and then
aspire to lead others, is an idea that should be crushed
once for all. It is not patriotism, it is murder.</p>

<p>Few amateurs would aspire to conduct the operations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
in a London hospital, and the operations of war
are, in their way, no less intricate, and perhaps entail
more loss of life and limb when conducted by the
unskilled. The amateur who comes out to the war,
with the courage of ignorance, and finds how helpless
he is, how useless are his best efforts, how complete
the disillusionment of those under him as to his
power to keep or get them out of trouble, let alone
hurt the enemy, will, if he survives, have learnt a
very useful and painful lesson, but no nation can
afford to give lessons on the field of battle.</p>

<p>The cavalry of an army are a part of a machine,
in which reliance must be placed, and in which every
nut or screw of doubtful metal is a danger. Cherfils
rightly says: “Three-quarters of the strategy of war
lies in the method of employment of the cavalry.”
Why? Because of the supreme importance to the
generalissimo of <cite>Liberty of Manœuvre</cite>. But this
liberty can only be gained by a thrusting forward of
masses of cavalry, <em>which must go on</em> and get the
greatest share of the terrain intervening between the
two armies. As an instance of this, in the Ulm
Campaign on the 4th October Napoleon in his orders
to Murat makes it plain that he wants him to push
aside the enemy’s patrols and make plenty of
prisoners; he tells him to take <em>three</em> divisions of
cavalry and do so, leaving <em>one</em> division only to watch
his left flank, that on which Napoleon was making his
main infantry advance. He left the initiative to
Murat.</p>

<p>Does any one imagine that these cavalry masses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
could, solely by means of musketry fire, drive the
enemy out of the positions which they will take up,
on finding a stronger force of cavalry in front of
them? We believe certain people do reckon on this,
though it has never occurred in actual combat, and (in
the opinion of those who have witnessed attempts at
it) will not do so in the immediate future. Across the
open plains the weaker, worse armed and equipped
cavalry will keep falling back rapidly to the next
defensive line. If this is a river or range of hills,
experience shows that the stronger cavalry will soon
cross it and move forward.</p>

<p>Too much emphasis can hardly be laid on the value
of success in the first great cavalry combat, in “initial
ascendancy.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> Let those who doubt this inquire of
any who have been on stricken fields and have learnt
the great lessons only taught by defeat.</p>

<p>But these lessons are not to be confused with the
tendency to say “A” nation beat “B” nation, therefore
“A” nation’s methods are right, and forthwith
slavishly follow their methods, even carrying this so
far as to follow the fashion of some pelisse or <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">pickelhaube</i>
as well.</p>

<p>Occasionally the Boers read us a lesson, and, as
Kipling says, “a jolly good lesson too”; at once there
is a great rush to imitate their methods, by those
impressed by them, as though these were applicable
to every possible case. To take one case&mdash;they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
certainly not suitable for mounted troops who wish to
advance. In that case we want the resolute offensive,
with a thorough understanding in all ranks that they
must be prepared to fight for information and liberty
of manœuvre. Now spectators of any large fight in
South Africa cannot claim to have seen this resolute
offensive on the part of the Boers. They never
pushed us back, partly, no doubt, from difficulties of
command, but chiefly from defective armament and
training, and consequent inability to bring the
combat to a hand-to-hand fight. On the other
hand, they fell back fighting whenever we attacked
resolutely. Exactly what a generalissimo could
not permit his cavalry to do. Why? Because
he, by doing so, surrenders his share of liberty of
manœuvre, of which there is a limited amount between
the armies, to his adversary.</p>

<p>Our conclusion is that <em>the trained cavalry masses
which have a personal weapon and good support
from horse artillery will push back any improvised
or worse-armed cavalry with the utmost rapidity
across all open ground, and that the moral ascendancy
thus established will render the enemy’s defeat
in rough ground an easy task</em>.</p>

<p class="in0">“Fundamental principles of action against different arms must be
laid down so definitely that complicated orders in each particular
case will not be required. This is needed because the utmost possible
independence of leaders down to the squadron commander is desirable.
It must not degenerate into selfish wilfulness.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Von Bernardi.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>That modern horse artillery coupled with cavalry
and machine guns has almost unlimited opportunities
can hardly be gainsaid. Only a madman or an
absolute ignoramus would willingly dispense with
horse artillery. But can it be said that, without an
organization and training in peace-time, which has
afforded full opportunity of practising every situation
which we can meet, we shall get full co-operation
in war?</p>

<p>Arms brought together almost for the first time on
the battlefield cannot have mutual confidence in one
another. Yet how much depends on a thorough
understanding and good feeling between the cavalry
leader and his commander of horse artillery. If
the battery commander cannot from constant practice
and usage actually foretell nine times out of ten
what the cavalry brigadier will order at a certain
stage of the attack, or if the officer commanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
horse artillery of a cavalry division does not know by
intuition his divisional general’s views, farewell to any
idea of valuable combination between the two arms.</p>

<p>Heretofore this brotherhood of arms has not
existed, nor has our organization aimed at effecting it.</p>

<p>Langlois in <cite>Lessons from Two Recent Wars</cite>,
p. 140, puts this very tersely:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Cavalry has need of the support of the other arms in
strategical exploration.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">And again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The English took no steps in peace to create and
strengthen any union between the arms, and evil overtook
them. I cannot insist too much on this point, and we
(the French) must profit by the lesson.</p></blockquote>

<p>A large number of horse artillery officers never
have opportunities of working with cavalry. Our
horse artillery batteries are too often quartered
where such cannot be obtained. But even at places
like Aldershot and the Curragh little can be done in
this direction, the ground is too cramped and too well
known, and there was always the necessity of a good
classification at the practice camp haunting the mind
of the battery commander, and making him grudge
every moment not spent in the direction of attaining
that most important item.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it is hard to find concrete examples
of cavalry and horse artillery action. For good
horse artillery and cavalry, trained to work in
conjunction, on modern ideas, have never yet been
seen on any battlefield in the latter part of the nineteenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
century. In 1870? No. In South Africa?
No. In Manchuria? A thousand times no. We have
to go back to the days of Frederick and Napoleon.</p>

<p>In all cases where the army is on the defensive a
great and potent factor is in the energy of the attack,
or, as one might put it, in carrying through the whole
according to prearrangement and “at one run,” so that
the gun and machine-gun fire is directed at that
particular portion of the defence which can offer most
opposition, and do most damage to the attack.</p>

<p>Let us take an instance of a cavalry attack on
dismounted men holding an isolated kopje. Starting
from 1200 yards’ distance, and suddenly appearing
over a ridge, one squadron of the attacking
cavalry riding <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en fourrageur</i>, supported by another
squadron echeloned on the first squadron’s flank, will
probably reach the dead ground, which exists in the
front of nearly every kopje, when within some 400
yards of the enemy’s firing line; then their leader
should give the order “Right turn,” or “Left turn”
(never “Right wheel” or “Left wheel” of troops,
which would obviously cause them to afford a good
mark), and gallop to one flank or the other. He
should of course choose the weakest flank. (It
may assist him in his decision if he remembers that,
in a force rapidly taking up a position on a hill, the
greater number of rifles will go to the right side, as they
approach it, because there the hill will cover all but
a small portion of their body and head as they shoot;
but on the left side, unless left-handed, half the body
will be shown.) See <a href="#i_VIII">Diagram VIII</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<div id="i_VIII" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_104.jpg" width="376" height="552" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram VIII.</span></div></div>

<p>Arrived at the flank, whilst the artillery and
machine guns of the attack shell that end of the
ridge to be attacked from the moment the cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
leader makes his right or left turn, he halts and
dismounts his men (that is, if the ground is unsuitable
for mounted action), and sweeps the hill from end
to end; the artillery, etc., now firing one hundred
yards in front of his line of men. His other squadron
should, meanwhile, “go for” the led horses. What
time is at the defender’s disposal if this attack
is made suddenly? Frederick the Great used to
say: “Rapidity is an element of particular importance
in the tactical offensive; therefore the
sharper attacks are, the fewer men they will cost.”</p>

<p>Picture yourself on the ridge, where ten minutes
before the enemy’s cavalry have been reported as
moving apparently away from or parallel to the
defence. Your men have resumed their avocations;
if they have been there some time, some will be cooking,
others sleeping. Suddenly some unusually alert
individual shouts out, “Hallo! the enemy are galloping
straight at us.” Men scramble to the sangars, or
are waked up and hustled to their loopholes. They
will not be ready to fire under a minute; this will
bring the enemy’s cavalry at a gallop over six
hundred yards nearer. For two or three hundred
yards the attackers will be exposed to magazine fire,
but they are certainly not an easy mark, and few
would fall, even on a rifle range. But at this moment
during the twenty or thirty seconds which elapse
before most of them will be in dead ground, a perfect
inferno of shell and, still worse, machine-gun fire
bursts on the ridge. Many men will now slightly
shift their position in order to get more cover and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
wait for the enemy to come straight on, nearer, where
they can see him. But the attack does not come on;
instead, it has slipped away to a flank, and the men’s
next thought will be for their led horses and so on.
They are already beat.</p>

<p>This is no fancy picture of artillery and machine-gun
support, but a method which was utilized a score
of times in the latter part of the operations of 1899–1902
in South Africa by both cavalry and mounted
colonials. It is one which can be made, where the
artillery and machine guns are in cool, skilled hands,
with comparative safety, but it is not one which the
average cavalryman would care to make, supported
by rifle fire, unless the latter can be brought up to
six hundred or seven hundred yards’ distance, where
they can distinguish friend from foe.</p>

<p>Whilst by the above we attempt to show that
horse artillery is a most valuable accessory to cavalry
in the attack, we believe it is even more efficacious
in retreat. An artillery officer sent in advance of
the rearguard can select various positions from which
horse artillery, practically covered from view, can put
a few shells into the mass of the enemy’s troops, as
they pass some defile; or it may engage the hostile
artillery in order to draw fire off the retreating
cavalry, if the former exposes itself unduly. Meantime
another section or battery is sent on, thus the
action is taken up successively. In every case the
ground should be selected so that it is (i.) possible to
act in combination with the cavalry, and (ii.) withdraw
without the enemy seeing the movement. Nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
must it be forgotten that the enemy may engage in
the “parallel pursuit,” consequently the wider the
front shown by the force covering the retreat the
better.</p>

<p>Thus it may happen that, following the rule that
in a retreat the most mobile troops should be
farthest out to the flanks, a cross fire may be
brought by two sections on the enemy’s pursuit.
The drill regulations of German cavalry, 1909, impress
the point</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">... that, should the issue of the battle prove unfavourable,
the cavalry must strain every nerve to facilitate the retreat
of the other arms. It is in just such cases that they
must assume a restless offensive. Repeated attacks on the
flanks of pursuing troops will produce the best results.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">In regard to the many other occasions on which
horse artillery can assist cavalry they say:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The horse artillery will often by its fire cause the foe to
disclose his strength and thus help reconnaissance. In
union with maxims it enables the opposition of the enemy
in occupied positions and defiles to be overcome, and thus
spares the cavalry a dismounted attack.</p>

<p>Horse artillery and machine guns enable the cavalry to
hem in at long range the enemy’s marching columns, to
cause these to partially deploy through flank fire to change
the direction of their march.</p></blockquote>

<p>Horse artillery is the one thing that prevents an
enemy sitting still and thus preventing the cavalry
factor of mobility asserting itself.</p>

<span class="subhead">CO-OPERATION OF HORSE ARTILLERY WITH CAVALRY
IN THE GENERAL ENGAGEMENT</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“Cavalry has more need of artillery than infantry, because it cannot
reply to fire, but can fight only with the steel.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Napoleon.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Of close co-operation by the horse artillery in the
charges of cavalry against infantry there is practically
little or no trace in the battles of 1870. The training
of cavalry and horse artillery and the organization
of the cavalry division had not proceeded on these
lines, as is evident from the fact that there is no
mention of it in books such as Von Schmidt before
that war, or in Prince Kraft’s <cite>Letters on Cavalry</cite>
after it. The latter writer shows that the tendency
was to deprive the cavalry division of its horse
artillery when a battle took place, and put it with
the corps artillery. It was claimed that by so doing
the horse artillery were practically of double use.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The batteries remain as a rule with the corps artillery.
If the cavalry division is sent forward, they are attached to
it. If a battle takes place during which the cavalry
division is held in reserve, then the horse artillery becomes
again a part of the corps artillery and considerably
augments its fire. The horse artillery of the Guards corps
was thus employed in 1870.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
For a cavalry division which takes part in a great battle
<em>does not require any horse artillery</em>. It is held at first in
reserve.</p>

<p>If it is called upon to attack it is obliged to make use of
an opportunity of charging broken troops of the enemy.
There is thus no need to break up its enemy with artillery
fire, and there is, besides, no time to do so.</p></blockquote>

<p>Compare with the above the 1907 amendments to
the German <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Exerzier Reglement für die Kavallerie
1895</cite>, No. 375:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In a general engagement the batteries and machine
guns told off to the cavalry <em>will remain with them</em>,
because they are indispensable to the cavalry in the fulfilment
of their special duties during, and particularly after,
the battle.</p>

<p>The cavalry leader must, however, judge whether the
general position does not rather demand the employment of
his batteries in co-operation with the rest of the artillery.
The horse artillery and machine guns will be of the greatest
use in a general engagement when the cavalry are operating
against the enemy’s flanks and rear. Their sudden
appearance from a flank or from the rear is certain to
produce a strong moral effect on the enemy.</p></blockquote>

<p>There could scarcely be a greater <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">volte face</i> than
is indicated by these two extracts.</p>

<p>Further, what we read of the use of masses of
cavalry at the present date, in both the German and
French manœuvres, leads us to the conclusion that
their cavalry and horse artillery will be kept together
in a general engagement and used for the sledge-hammer
blow on both shaken and unshaken infantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
The reader should study some of the instances
given in Colonel Maude’s book, <cite>Cavalry: Its Past
and Future</cite>, chaps. xi. and xii., of the charges by
cavalry on infantry in the 1870 war, and picture to
himself what would have been the results if these
charges had been preluded by even five minutes’ gun
fire of one battery of modern horse artillery, say
350 accurately placed shells, containing in all 83,600
projectiles.</p>

<p>A conclusion early arrived at in the consideration
of the rôle of the three arms on the modern battlefield
is that no artillery and infantry force, however
strong, can afford to enter upon a battle unless their
flanks are protected by natural obstacles or by masses
of cavalry. But battles, except where we adopt the
defensive, are not fought where natural obstacles
cover our flank. Therefore, we must have sufficient
cavalry if only to neutralize the enemy’s cavalry,
otherwise they will work round our flank and attack
our reserves, and, if they are accompanied by horse
artillery, whilst our horse and field artillery is already
engaged in the great battle, they possess a marked
advantage over us.</p>

<p>The latest instance of the need of cavalry and
horse artillery is furnished by Captain Spaits, who
himself went through the retreat with the Russians
after Mukden, in his book, <cite>With Cossacks through
Manchuria</cite>.</p>

<p>He “and many others who realized the panic-stricken
frame of mind of the masses of men who
were pouring back without arms and without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
discipline” are of opinion that a “couple of good
cavalry divisions, energetically led and provided with
artillery and machine guns, could have turned the
retreat into a complete annihilation of the army.”</p>

<p>The above inference is obvious when one considers
the impression made on the flying troops by a
few hundred indifferent horsemen.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>Having, it is hoped, to the reader’s satisfaction,
demonstrated that cavalry with horse artillery have
a great rôle on the battlefield against infantry, if
(i.) the conditions are favourable, (ii.) the attack is
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à propos</i>, and (iii.) properly supported by horse
artillery and machine-gun fire, we turn to the form
which the attack against infantry should take.
<cite>Cavalry Training</cite> indicates that it should be
made in a succession of lines; and it may be added
that it is of the highest importance that these attacks
should not be made without sufficient preliminary
reconnaissance on the part of the cavalry leader
accompanied by the commander of his artillery, and
that subsequently the action of the infantry should
be decided upon in conjunction with the infantry
commander in that portion of the field.</p>

<p>That the infantry should not stand open-mouthed,
but should press in at the right moment, is of the
highest importance. As far as the troops are
concerned, the formation is a simple one; but there
are two points which demand forethought and
arrangement. The first is the best position for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the supporting fire; the second is the rallying-point.
In these circumstances it appears best to have in
one’s mind an ideal, as a guide, and endeavour in the
actual fight to approximate to it&mdash;and we may turn
to the memoirs of Napoleon for the solution. He
says: “A flanking battery which strikes and rakes
the enemy obliquely is capable of deciding victory
in itself.”</p>

<p>The ideal then appears to be: “A,” when the fire
effect is delivered at right angles to the direction of
the successive lines of cavalry; and “B,” when the
rallying-point is fixed on the flank away from the
general engagement and under cover from the enemy’s
fire; “C,” when we utilize surprise. It is usually in
the return from such enterprises after rallying that
nine-tenths of the loss takes place. A good instance
is that of Michel’s brigade at the battle of Woerth;
see page 203, Maude’s <cite>Cavalry: Its Past and
Future</cite>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Suddenly the wreck of the ten squadrons of Michel’s
Brigade, now making the best of their way back at full
speed, but still preserving some attempt at formation,
appeared right in rear of the Prussians. The latter at once
wheeled troops about and charged at full gallop from the
halt. Owing to the suddenness of the attack there was no
time to deploy, though the outer troops attempted to gallop
up into line; but the shock was sufficient to discomfort the
French. There was a short mêlée, and then the Prussians,
promptly rallying, swept up the debris of the French, and
brought in some sixty prisoners and many riderless horses.
The prompt resolution to attack and the rapid rally both
deserve very high commendation.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Many writers of recent date, and especially those
who are impressed with an exaggerated idea of
the accuracy of rifle fire, those, in fact, of the De
Bloch School, are under the impression that cavalry
will not charge infantry. It is probable that,
never having ridden in a force of cavalry passing
through a fire-swept zone, they are unaware how
much simpler it is than the attack on cavalry or
artillery, and how much less resolution is needed.</p>

<p>In the case of cavalry there is the apparently
inevitable concussion which is seen to be nearing; in
the former a few men or horses drop almost unnoticed
by their comrades, but most of them “carry on” for
a long way after being hit. As the enemy are
reached, the desire for slaughter overrides all other
thoughts; cavalry should then be taught to go
straight on, taking with the point what comes to
them and riding their horses at speed in the direction
of the rallying-point.</p>

<p>An example of the “counter-attack by a cavalry
division on hostile infantry in order to gain time for
reserves to come up” is given in General Sir D.
Haig’s <cite>2nd Cavalry Staff Ride</cite>, p. 40:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The problem here presented is one of considerably more
danger and difficulty than that of completing the rout of
beaten troops and reaping the fruits of victory. The
enemy’s infantry, far from having lost their <em>moral</em>, are
pressing victoriously to the attack, and, though the leading
echelons may have sustained heavy losses from the fire of
the defence, there are troops in reserve and support which
retain their cohesion and steadiness. The responsibility for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
ordering an attack of this nature ... rests with the
commander-in-chief. Against such an objective it is useless
to send regiments at the gallop. It is necessary to (1)
prepare the attack, concentrate the means for it, and bring
a converging fire of guns, machine guns, and infantry upon
the objective; (2) make a definite plan. This must be
based on what can be seen of the enemy and his position,
the use of ground, the most opportune moment; (3)
dispose the troops methodically by the execution of the
plan, and assign to them, if possible, their objectives;
(4) give the signal for the attack at the right moment.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the <cite>Manual of Infantry Training</cite>, 1905, under
“Formations Applicable to Savage Warfare,” is found
S. No. 118, which contains an instruction for
“Meeting an Attack by Cavalry or Swordsmen.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When a battalion in line is threatened by cavalry or
swordsmen in force, it may sometimes be desirable to dress
back the threatened flank and to dress up the unmenaced flank,
the battalion commander giving the command, “Back, No.
&mdash;&mdash;, up, No. &mdash;&mdash;.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a formation if adopted in ordinary warfare
against cavalry would favour the fire of artillery and
machine guns, if the latter are placed at right angles
to the attack as indicated above.</p>

<p>May, writing in 1896, <cite>Guns and Cavalry</cite>, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>True, there may be opportunities when cavalry and
horse artillery moving rapidly, even during the progress of
a great battle, may anticipate the foe at some decisive point,
and may make or prevent a telling flank movement. But
for such occasions special arrangements could no doubt be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
made as the exigencies of the moment might dictate, and we
need not legislate for them beforehand.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is evident from the German regulations quoted
above that they have no intention of trusting to
the “Special arrangements” for “Exigencies.”</p>

<p>Their reasons no doubt are somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>1st. Horse artillery is an integral part of the
cavalry.</p>

<p>2nd. Attacks on unshaken infantry depend upon
horse artillery for such a preparation as will speedily
reduce infantry to shaken infantry.</p>

<p>3rd. In order to get freedom of manœuvre for
our squadrons to a flank, cavalry are bound to meet
an enemy’s cavalry force, possibly belonging to an
enemy whose cavalry does not leave its horse artillery
behind with the corps artillery in a great general
engagement.</p>

<p>On which side wins will depend the subsequent
course of events on that flank.</p>

<p>4th. A cavalry force of three regiments and one
battery of horse artillery is quite equal, or more
than equal, to one of four regiments without horse
artillery.</p>

<p>Having in view the above consideration, cavalry
should not be prepared to forgo their horse artillery
in a great general engagement, since it foredooms
them to the inaction of the French and German
cavalry divisions of the war of 1870, or perhaps to
their comparative failure and losses, when, unsupported
by horse artillery fire, they attacked infantry
columns to cover the retreat of their own infantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Special arrangements of this kind are not made,
and we know also, too well, that “No man can serve
two masters.”</p>

<p>The latest German regulations appear, therefore, to
have been formulated on sound reasoning.</p>

<span class="subhead">HORSE ARTILLERY FIRE EFFECT COMPARED
WITH RIFLE FIRE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Henderson in <cite>Science of War</cite>, written in 1893–1902,
asked the question, whether the necessary fire power
should be found by the cavalry itself or by a body
of mounted riflemen attached to the brigade or the
division? and answered it by proposing trained
mounted infantry. To the view that this fire power
had better be supplied by the horse artillery he
gives little or no consideration. Machine guns are
also more or less ignored, and yet these in common
with horse artillery are what the <em>cavalry attack</em>
requires most in support.</p>

<p>Those who have frequently had to rely on fire
to cover a mounted advance will agree that
the fire of two hundred riflemen at eight rounds a
minute for five minutes is not to be compared in
efficacy with the shells of a Q.F. horse artillery
battery. Their comparative value would work out in
projectiles as follows:</p>

</table>
<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
That is, the riflemen fire less than 1/8 of the number
of projectiles fired by a battery, or 1770 riflemen
shoot as many projectiles as a battery in five
minutes.</p>

<p>It is superfluous to remark on the range attained
by the Q.F. gun compared with the rifle, but it is to
the point to bring to notice that a Q.F. battery is
controlled by one individual who is furnished with
good glasses, and that the guns have telescopic sights.
At a mile he will distinguish his own side. Again
the battery’s front is 100 yards compared to the
mile of front required by 1770 riflemen. The battery
is in action within one minute and thirty seconds,
whereas from the time the order is given a brigade
of mounted riflemen will not be in action under five
minutes at least, and will not be shooting with any
degree of accuracy under eight minutes. Further,
the fire of a big line of one mile in length cannot be
directed, whereas a battery can be switched on and
off, or so many degrees to a flank, and so on, by
a simple command.</p>

<p>It is obvious, then, that in the attack of infantry,
whether unshaken or shaken, the extended line of
charging cavalry will find their most reliable support
in horse artillery and machine-gun fire and not in
the fire of dismounted men.</p>

<p>Henderson would therefore appear to have written
at this time under the influence of the then accepted
theory that the horse artillery would not be available
to assist cavalry in a general engagement. He was
also much impressed by the view that mounted infantry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
should supply the fire power for cavalry and prevent
cavalry having recourse to fire action as much as
possible; since he considered that the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élan</i> of the
cavalryman would soon disappear, if once accustomed
to dismount and fire as an alternative to shock action
when the latter was feasible.</p>

<p>To sum up, present-day opinion is not in favour
of mounted infantry being attached to cavalry
brigades, but on the other hand horse artillery and
machine guns will remain with cavalry in the general
engagement, ready for any opportunity.</p>

<p>In order once more to emphasize the opinion that
these charges of cavalry on infantry demand exceptional
arrangements on the part of the general
commanding the cavalry and his artillery commander,
the case quoted by Prince Kraft in
<cite>Letters on Cavalry</cite>, page 64, may be cited.
Speaking of a French cavalry charge on Prussian
infantry at Woerth, a Prussian infantry officer told
him that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At the moment our infantry were falling back down a slope
from an attack which had failed, a hail of Chassepot and
Mitrailleuse bullets followed them, and every one felt that
he would never reach the cover of the wood which lay
below them.</p>

<p>Tired to death and resigned to their fate, the whole
of the infantry were slowly crawling towards the wood.
Suddenly the murderous fire ceased. Every one stopped,
astonished, to see what had saved them from the fate which
seemed certain to them. Then they saw the French
cuirassiers who, as they pushed forward, <em>masked the fire</em>
of their infantry and artillery. These cuirassiers appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
to them like guardian angels. With the most perfect
calm every man halted on the spot where he stood and
fired at the cuirassiers, who were soon swept away by the
rapid fire.</p></blockquote>

<p>He adds at p. 67:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We see, moreover, that cavalry charges, if they break
out from the front of their own infantry and <em>mask the fire
of the latter</em>, enable the infantry which is charged to
gain time, owing to the cessation of this fire, to recover their
formation.</p></blockquote>

<p>The above is one more argument in favour of
constantly training our cavalry leaders till it is a
second nature to apply shock at right angles to fire
effect, and on no account whatever to mask the fire
of their own artillery and infantry, and thus become
the “guardian angels” of the infantry whom they are
attacking.</p>

<p>Von Bernardi appears to lose sight of this, when
he says, p. 208, <cite>Cavalry in Peace and War</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is obvious that not only the preliminary deployment,
but the formation, for the attack, must take place beyond
the effective range of the enemy’s fire ... and nothing
else can be done but to gallop straight to the front. As,
however, our infantry will have to be ridden through in
the charge, it is impossible in such a case to attack in close
order.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This is what we consider should be avoided in the
dispositions of the cavalry leader.</p>

<p>Again, p. 200, Von Bernardi says: “The attack
will best take place from the flank.” To this there
is the objection that there is not likely to be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
good rallying-point in the middle of the enemy’s
line.</p>

<p>Our conclusion is that these attacks will be least
costly if they break out from our line in valleys
running at right angles to it, or round the contour
of a hill, and sweep the enemy by a charge parallel
to our front, and that the rallying-point should
be outside the flank or within our own line.</p>

<p>On the occasions when our infantry or dismounted
riflemen made one of their regular attacks in
extended order on the positions taken up by the
Boers, there were almost invariably not only critical
moments, but also opportunities afforded by the lie
of the ground which invited a leader at the head of
three or four squadrons of lancers to issue from cover
in or near the Boer lines at a gallop in open order,
and to sweep over the widely extended men. Three
to four minutes at most would have covered the time
during which these lancers would have been exposed
to fire; then they could have reached a rallying-point
in their own lines.</p>

<p>There are good grounds for the belief that such an
attack is extremely demoralizing, especially if the
troops have not been accustomed in peace-time to
undergo it.</p>

<span class="subhead">IN CONTACT WITH THE ENEMY</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>“The most arduous, while at the same time the most important,
duties that devolve upon soldiers in the field are those of outposts
... all concerned should feel that the safety of the army and the
honour of the country depend upon their untiring vigilance and
activity.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Wolseley.</span></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The art of maintaining himself and his command in
the outpost line is a question of vigilance, imagination,
and forethought on the part of the commander, and
cunning on the part of his men. Let us place ourselves
in the position of an officer commanding a
hundred to two hundred men, and detached some ten
miles out to the flank and front of a force.</p>

<p>The commander must take it for granted that he
may be attacked at any moment, and so he must run
through in his mind what he intends to do. It is
his business to look ahead and foresee dangers and
misfortunes&mdash;and by his preparations to rob them
of their bad effect.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> If he has left his bivouac a
couple of hours before dawn and moved, carefully
feeling his way, in the direction of the enemy, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
has perhaps driven in one of their outposts, he need
not feel it incumbent on him to hold the ground
gained <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à outrance</i>. He has seen into their outpost
line, gained certain information, and come to certain
conclusions; therefore when the enemy attack him,
as they certainly will do, he should have made all
preparations to fall back to the bit of good ground
previously selected, where he can see and where his
movements cannot be seen. Here he can make a
good show, and ten to one they will let him stay
there. But instead of staying there with 100 men all
day, which would fatigue his men and horses without
result, he places some Cossack posts and a small
picket or two and retires all the rest of his men,
without the enemy’s knowledge, to his bivouac, and is
at breakfast by 9 or 10 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, his horses watered and fed.
At 4 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> he canters out to his posts, spends the
remaining daylight in observation of the enemy’s
movements, relief of posts, etc., and withdraws his
Cossack posts and picket at dark, leaving the picket
fires well stoked up; one or two men only are left to
feed these fires at intervals through the night. His
real line of night outposts is placed on the possible
lines of advance to his bivouac. But if his bivouac
can be observed, or is likely to be reported upon to
the enemy, he may change it after dark. His men
should have been practised so constantly in alarm
posts at night that they know exactly where to go,
and what to do in case of a night alarm, and how to
do so in absolute silence. Only the C.O. may make
a few uncomplimentary remarks about the enemy in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
a stentorian voice, and invite them to “come on,”
which goes far to cool the ardour of a night attack
and hearten up his own men.</p>

<p>Next morning up again at two hours before dawn
by the sound of a long-drawn-out whistle, upsaddle
and off again, and get into your outpost line before
dawn or, if preferred, take up a fresh line.</p>

<p>During the day there is plenty to do, but it is
well to have an hour or so during which the men get
a sleep; though with most men, after a time, it
becomes a habit to sleep whenever they have nothing
to do or think about, and, if they go to sleep directly
it is dark, and do not sit up and talk, they get
enough sleep, and are alert before dawn. All talking
should be stopped a quarter of an hour after dark in
every part of the lines.</p>

<p>The men soon learn the routine, and know how
to take care of themselves, sleeping, bathing, washing,
and feeding when they get a chance, and forming
into small messes of four or five, who co-operate in
all their food, messing, and fuel arrangements. In a
very short time everything begins to go smoothly.
The kits are packed, horses saddled, waggons
inspanned, and coffee drunk in twenty minutes to
half an hour (considerably less if there is an alarm)
from the time the men are roused, whether in the
dark or not. It is only when they have attained a
fair degree of celerity that their C.O. can feel any
confidence in them in the outpost line.</p>

<p>The officers, except the quarter-master and
adjutant, must attend every stable hour, see the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
horses finished before the men leave stables, and
one officer per squadron must also go to water.
One glance is enough to tell an experienced eye
if all is right with a horse or not. They cannot
speak, but they are very full of expression if
anything is wrong. The good troop and squadron
leader is for ever solicitous about his horses, and
woe betide the unlucky stable-guard whom he catches
resting his back against a bale of hay when there is
a horse loose. Once it is understood that each man
stands or falls in the squadron leader’s estimation, and
is noted for punishment or a light reprimand when
brought up before him, according to the care of his
horse, everything will go well. Nothing less will
make some of them always keep up to the mark.</p>

<p>Nor must you forget the magpie instinct in some
men, which leads them to collect all sorts of rubbish
and carry it on their horses. So, on some favourable
occasion on the march, halt near a deep river or
pond, hold a kit and saddlery inspection, and hurl
far into the water all unauthorized articles. Let
the leader set the example himself of walking
and leading his horse a great deal, especially down
hills, when the loaded saddle slips forward on to the
shoulder-blades. This is the merest routine, but a
hundred things will occupy the C.O.’s mind. First,
forage and water in plenty for his horses. Second,
food and firing for his men. It is essential to keep
the men well fed, dry,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> if possible, and that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
should always have their coffee and tea, and in
trying times their glass of rum twice a week or so.
Soap and tobacco are the other main essentials. If
you can give them half their ration in flour and
half in biscuit, it will preserve their health. There
are at least twenty reasons why, if you requisition
anything, you should never permit the slightest
waste or prodigality. De Brack says truly: “In
peace wastefulness is a wrong; in war it is a crime.”
Always see a receipt is given in due form.</p>

<p>Detached, or in the outpost line, you are more
likely to get shelter in rainy weather for your horses
and men than in a big camp. Take advantage of this,
but recollect that it entails extra vigilance as a rule
in your outposts, and that to get out of a farm and
into a fighting formation requires forethought, prearrangement,
and test practice, and usually entails
the improvement of existing exits, and the blocking
of all approaches, etc.</p>

<p>One of the rules, in all contact with the enemy,
is always to do the opposite to what you appear to
him to be about to do, <i>e.g.</i> never go straight to the
point for which you are really making. Never come
straight back to your support. Mystify him as
much as you can. Never do the same thing two
days running. Always come back from a patrol by
a different way from that by which you went out.
When alone go across country rather than on the
tracks. Patrols should go across open country in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
the dark and be in observation and concealed before
dawn. Cunning rather than audacity is required, and
should be rewarded when it has good results.</p>

<p>Scouts have a hard time, and it is most important
to have relays of them and not to let them go out
too many nights running. They must also learn to
put up with or remain impervious to that foolish and
abominable remark of Tommy Knowall, the young
and inexperienced staff or intelligence officer: “WE
knew all that before.” If chased in by superior
numbers, double as a buck or fox does directly you
are out of sight.</p>

<p>If you are scouting near the enemy’s lines do not
take cover on your side of rocks, bushes, etc., but on
theirs, and turn your horses and pretend to look
back at your own side. They will hesitate to fire on
you at 700 yards or upwards, as they will think you
are their own scouts riding in. But never permit a
party of your own scouts to ride in to your line
without sending one of their number to gallop on
and tell you who they are. A shot “across the
bows” of one of your own parties which is coming
into a line of videttes or bivouac, without taking
this precaution, will soon teach them all to do so.
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">À propos</i> of this, “punishments should fit the
crime,” they are more easily remembered; after all,
punishments are for the prevention of similar conduct
in others and not retaliatory.</p>

<p>A high standard of conduct, zeal, and bravery
comes from the example set in the first few
encounters of coolness and light-heartedness. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
C.O. whose men were under a wearing fire was sent
a message by a troop leader, who did not quite enjoy
the situation, asking, “What shall I do?” The
reply was, “Give your men the second lecture on
musketry.”</p>

<p>No one likes to be out of the fashion, and it is
desirable to lay stress on not coming off second best
to the enemy; to give him more than you get; to
make him pay for his audacity heavily, and so on.
To do so distracts the men’s minds from your own
losses in dead or wounded men, etc., of which you
must make little.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> Much mourning for the dead
makes men sorry for themselves too, and has a bad
effect. Shakespeare tells us:</p>

</div>

<p>Deceiving the enemy by ruses, and killing or taking
him prisoner, is very desirable, and plans for doing
so should be thought over and deliberately carried
out. Henderson, <cite>Science of War</cite>, p. 101, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To sustain the <em>moral</em> of his own men; to break down
the <em>moral</em> of his enemy&mdash;these are the great objects which,
if he be ambitious of success, the leader must always keep
in view.</p></blockquote>

<p>Shaikh Sadi says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If thou art harsh the foe will fight shy of thee; if thou
art lenient they will be audacious and forward.</p></blockquote>

<p>If the force to which you belong suffers reverses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
early in the war, “traitors,” “spies,” etc., are words
which one may hear, and they will be applied ungenerously,
indiscriminately, and invariably wrongly.
Any talk of this sort should be sternly repressed; it
is due to a craven desire to blame others for their
own cowardice, which some men, curs and runaways
themselves, are base enough to indulge in. This will
certainly not help them to be brave on future
occasions, whilst it serves to disintegrate a force. It
will be found that on those men who are practised
frequently in going up to the enemy’s pickets before
dawn, and retiring gradually, there is not, even in a
severe retreat, the same bad moral effect which there
is on unpractised men.</p>

<p>A very important point to impress on your men
is the following. No horseman should believe that he
cannot escape capture, or that a bullet will hit him.
Let it be clearly understood by all that, as the saying
goes, “A horseman and a heavy shower of rain can
get through anything.” Snap-shots fired by men in
haste, or when excited, never do hit any one who is
mounted and moving, especially if the firer is being
“peppered” himself. A very good reason this for
arranging for covering fire, if only by one rifle, when
riding up to ground likely to be held by the enemy’s
pickets. Another point to be remembered by scouts
is that when they get into the dead ground, which
is almost always to be found in front of a hill, they
should always change both their pace and direction,
and arrive at the top of the hill both sooner and at a
different point from where they might be reasonably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
expected to arrive. Again, scouts in their advance
should invariably look out for an alternative line of
retreat, especially if they cross an obstacle such as
a brook, ditch, or strong fence. They should not
expect to see the enemy’s picket or videttes if they
deliberately dismount in view and look for them.
But if they ride back over a hill, disappear, and then
creep back at another point, they are pretty sure to
see some heads coming up.</p>

<p>In all the arrangements to be made for sending
out scouts, never neglect the value of darkness for
getting near the enemy’s lines, or through their line
of pickets. What can be done with ease then, is
impossible in daytime for the cleverest scout in the
world, and it is foolish and unfair to scouts to ask
them to do this; in fact, it is seldom asked for
except by officers unacquainted with their business.
All who have attempted to shoot big game, even in
a fair moonlight, are aware how uncertain their aim
is then. Consequently, if a scout stumbles on a
sentry or picket at night, it is twenty chances to
one that he gets off without a bullet in him. This
fact it is well to remember when posting your own
pickets, whom you should protect from being rushed
by wires and ropes stretched a foot from the ground,
some ten yards or so from their post, rather than
trust to their rifle fire, for the “bullet is a fool.”</p>

<p>As will be seen from the above, pickets, Cossack
posts, and observing parties should be in position,
halted and invisible to the enemy before dawn, and
should not, as a rule, be withdrawn till dusk covers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
them from the enemy’s observation. It seems puerile
to urge these obviously common-sense precautions,
and they would be omitted were it not that experience
shows that they are most studiously neglected
by our regular and irregular troops till bitter experience
teaches their necessity.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>Sniping by nervous sentries, which will always
take place the first few nights on which untrained
or unseasoned troops are, or think they are, in contact
with the enemy (note the Dogger Bank episode with
Rozhestvenski’s fleet), must, and can be, at once
firmly put a stop to. To do so, give orders that the
C.O., adjutant, and regimental sergeant-major of
the corps, in whose section of outposts it occurs, are
at once to go and spend a couple of hours in the
outposts, and then on their return to report whether
“all is quiet in the outpost line.”</p>

<p>Young men, especially, are apt to get “rattled”
when “on sentry go,” and to imagine small bushes
and so on are the enemy’s scouts. Even fireflies are
known to have been mistaken for the enemy’s
lanterns and subjected to a heavy fire. When the
fire had ceased, and it became evident that they
<em>were</em> fireflies and not the enemy with lanterns, the
commander of the picket was much annoyed at
receiving an order to “Push in now and kill the
remainder with the bayonet.” Sentries had far better
rouse the rest of the group quietly in case of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
enemy really being on the move towards their
picket, and then all may fire a volley at “point
blank” range only.</p>

<p>It is frequently desirable to impress the enemy
with a mistaken estimate of your strength. This
might be done by sending a detachment out some
hours before dawn towards your base, then before it
is light they turn round and march in to your bivouac
in full daylight and in sight of the enemy as reinforcements.</p>

<p>There are obviously many plans by which an
enemy can be deceived as to the strength of your
force, if you can work behind cover, by first showing
a number of men in one place and then in another.
It is well to remember that even if an enemy sees you
acting with duplicity the effect is by no means a bad
one, as next time he sees you moving in your real
direction he may think the action is for his benefit,
and covers a movement from an entirely different
direction.</p>

<p>In the outposts a knowledge of strategy and battle
tactics is most necessary, and every officer should try
to make himself thoroughly acquainted with the
terrain, geography, and strategical issues of the campaign,
otherwise he may miss great chances, and his
extracts from the information, which he will get first
of all, may be valueless instead of being such as will
bring him to the favourable notice of his superiors.
Nor should his superiors forget the late Admiral
Makarov’s opinion, that “a sub-lieutenant acting
intelligently and sensibly was more useful to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
state than a flag officer who was carrying out to the
letter an order which he did not clearly understand.”</p>

<p>In regard to terrain, if, as is most probable, the
map is on a very small scale, the general direction
of the watershed is one of the best general helps in
finding the way.</p>

<p>It is absolutely necessary for any cavalry scout
moving at night to know enough of the stars to
orient himself and to guess correctly the time.
British troops serve in so many parts of the world
that no special instructions can be given, but Orion is
one of the constellations which may prove useful, and
which is quite unmistakable.</p>

<p>To establish a system by which you “picket the
enemy,” which may be defined as placing observers
round him so that he can make no movement without
your knowledge, is the acme of good work in the
outpost line: it is almost a counsel of perfection.
But there are two points which deserve consideration
in this connection: the first is that the mounted
men whom you employ for this purpose must know,
or have time to learn, the country thoroughly; and
the second is that, however thoroughly you may
imagine that you have picketed the enemy, he will
be able to move out of his environment at night, and
if your safety is based on knowledge of his movements
he will, as likely as not, upset your calculations.
This deduction is drawn from facts. The Boers
habitually picketed our garrison towns and columns,
but our columns, taking the ordinary precautions of
moving by night and off the main tracks or roads, constantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
surprised and captured their laagers of waggons.
The “desultory operations for two or three years in
South Africa,” 1899–1902, contain no unusual circumstances,
we are told, but one is tempted to consider
whether the outpost system evolved out of their own
consciousness by the Boers was not better than that
so laboriously studied by us in former days at
Sandhurst. Our system was almost entirely directed
towards “security,” and largely neglected “information.”
Theirs studied information of the enemy first,
a desire for security being a secondary consideration.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>As regards a service of information, certainly an
idea of using contact squadrons had long been known
and considered by us. Had we not long ago read
the fascinating account of Curély’s adventures in De
Brack, and also the “Conduct of a Contact Squadron,”
translated from the German? But it soon
became evident in South Africa that it was not very
easy to carry out; every native was of assistance to
the Boers, and afraid to serve us, even if we understood
their language and could interrogate them.
In this respect the Russians in Manchuria were almost
similarly handicapped. It will usually be the same
in war; one side can go anywhere, the other finds
every man’s hand against it. Under these circumstances,
to lay down one law for both sides is
obviously folly. Every report on the Peninsular
War shows the extent to which the French were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
handicapped by the guerrillas, and how our troops
were assisted.</p>

<p>De Brack and many other writers make it plain
that whilst from 1805 up to, perhaps, 1812 information
was easily gained by the French cavalry for
Napoleon, later a complete change came over the
scene, and the Cossacks, overrunning the country,
picketed the French columns. Perhaps the natives
were weary of French exactions, but in any case the
result is said to have been that “the genius of the
Emperor was paralysed by the activity of the
Cossacks.”</p>

<p>We have at least four or five instances where one
side’s light cavalry or guerrillas “paralysed the genius”
of the other’s generals by gaining superiority in the
outposts, or, rather, anywhere outside their opponent’s
outposts: (<i>a</i>) in 1812, 1813, 1814; (<i>b</i>) in the
Peninsular War; (<i>c</i>) in the early part of the
American Civil War; (<i>d</i>) in the South African
War; and (<i>e</i>) in the Manchurian War.</p>

<p>With these examples before us it must become a
serious factor in taking thought for a campaign, how
far the cavalry will be able to effect this. Our training
must be such as to enable us to play this part, of
picketing the enemy, if possible; certainly we should
do so in a friendly country.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> We know it is usually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
only done by the side which has a knowledge of the
country; but may not the almost universal knowledge
of map-reading in the cavalry and a good supply of
maps obviate this? But let us remember above all
things that nothing will be done in war which has not
by constant practice become a second nature in peace.
Let us then practise not only our officers, but our
men, in picketing every large body of troops which
train within fifty miles of us.</p>

<p>Often C.O.’s, shortsightedly we think, do not
welcome the attention of cavalry thus picketing
them; but even if this is the case, it may still be
practised by our cavalry, but in a way which does
not draw attention to the fact&mdash;the training will be
none the worse, and (though perhaps hardly in this
sense) the “offensive spirit” must be second nature
to us.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>The instruction of cavalry in outpost work is
difficult, because in the first place many parts of the
duty make great demands on the instructor’s imagination,
powers of explanation, and what we may call
ability for stage management.</p>

<p>In teaching recruits, it is far better, instead of
saying “You will imagine the enemy are in that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
direction,” to say, “Those red flags carried by horsemen,
or those men in the white caps <em>are</em> the enemy.”
Farther, the parties carrying the red flags should, in
order to show that they are enemies, take some action,
such as to come within about 800 to 600 yards, and
shoot with blank at the parties of recruits, retiring
when the latter return the fire, etc., etc. Beginning
from this point the recruit may be asked by the
instructor how they would suggest that the duties of
a vedette, or, better, “look-out man”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> should be
carried out, and he will then gradually impart to
them the accepted mode of outpost duty, which is,
after all is said and done, only common sense. For
it is certain that, under active service conditions,
men learn very quickly by their own mother-wit in
real dangers and difficulties what precautions are
necessary. These services are consequently ill taught
by theoretical instruction in the barrack-room, and
well taught if the work is done from the start in
the open, and, for choice, in unknown ground and
with a represented enemy. The ground also must be
changed constantly, and this, certainly in the United
Kingdom, is difficult, and makes considerable demands
on horse-flesh and on the instructor’s time. But it
is the one thing for which horse-flesh must not be
grudged, even though the work is thankless from the
point of view of immediate reward or recognition, for
it is work which presents more difficulties in regard
to inspection than any other; consequently, a careful
instructor gets little or no credit for his work till war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
begins. It is only then that the immense difference
between the cavalry or infantry, who are well grounded
and thoroughly honest in their outpost work and those
who are not so, comes to light in so-called “regrettable
incidents.”</p>

<p>A cunning enemy will soon discriminate between
those who do their outpost work well and those who do
it carelessly, and will attack the latter. It may be
of interest to state that a very close union soon grows
up between regiments of cavalry and infantry in a
column, where there is a mutual recognition of honest
work in the outposts, whilst there is a wholesome
detestation for slack regiments. A most important
point is to train men in the duty of night outposts,
whilst the subordinate leaders should have it dinned
into their minds that there is always a definite point
beyond which no one is to retire. It has been very
truly said that sentries always think of retiring on
groups, groups on pickets, pickets on supports, and
supports on reserves, with the result that the enemy
is in camp before you know where you are.</p>

<p>The training of regiments in the duties of outpost
work cannot be carried out really satisfactorily and
thoroughly unless the regiment goes into camp for a
few days. Otherwise, many of the real difficulties,
such as the cooking and supplies of food, the off-saddling,
watering, reliefs of sentries and pickets,
lighting of fires, arrangements for men to get a good
sleep, are never grasped.</p>

<span class="subhead">SOME DETACHED DUTIES</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>DESPATCH-RIDING</h3>

<p class="in0">One often hears a party of cavalrymen employed on
reconnoitring work blamed because they continue to
observe or follow up the enemy, whom they have just
discovered, without a thought of conveying the information
to those who sent them out. But this
forgetfulness is not to be wondered at when we call
to mind that in the first few weeks of the 1870 war
German officers were sent on long rides of 60 or 70
miles, whilst little or no arrangement was made for
the purpose of transmitting the information, obtained
at great risk and trouble. It leads one to think that
the subject of despatch-riding is one of those points
connected with war of which the knowledge lapses or
rusts in peace-time, or, like the manufacture of Waterford
glass, becomes a lost art.</p>

<p>To begin with, to train men in the duties of
despatch-riding with anything like thoroughness
entails a certain amount of prearrangement for food,
forage, and shelter for men and horses; for it cannot
be taught in the immediate vicinity of the town
where the men are quartered. In war it may entail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
cross-country work, if capture is to be avoided; whilst
the task on roads can often be carried out much
better by cyclists. It is suggested that this little-practised
art, despatch-riding, may be made to take
a form which will serve an excellent purpose in the
general instruction of the cavalryman. By it he
will learn (1) to take notice of the country passed
through; (2) to see a good reason for the trouble
now taken to instruct him in map-reading; (3) to
gain immensely in self-reliance; (4) to become an
expert in campaigning horse-management; (5) to
gain knowledge of pace.</p>

<p>In regard to the last point, pace, it may be
interesting to give some particulars of a despatch-riding
scheme. In this exercise a series of despatches
were sent from the east to the west of Ireland, 120
miles as the crow flies and about 135 by road, under
the following circumstances:&mdash;About eighty cavalrymen
under two years’ service and two subalterns were
billeted along a certain route. The base of this route
was shifted north or south after a few days, causing the
greater part of the line to be altered. Two messages
per diem were sent off at uncertain hours of day or
night, and were carried on from post to post without
intermission. The men were provided with maps at
4 miles to the inch. Three regiments furnished the
above detachment for this work in three successive
fortnights. The first regiment brought or took the
despatches through on the average in twenty-eight
hours; the second regiment in twenty-four hours; the
third regiment in twenty-two hours. The pace was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
not to exceed the walk and trot. The roads were
in fair condition.</p>

<p>When instruction in despatch-riding takes place, it
is of considerable importance to shift the line to one
flank or another after a few days. This may have to
be done at any time in an unfriendly country, and,
though it makes the exercise much more difficult, is
capital practice.</p>

<p>In several of Napoleon’s campaigns there are
incidentally indications of the extensive use then
made of despatch-riders. In the course of the Jena
Campaign Murat is reproached by Napoleon, who
writes to him as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A despatch took six hours to come to hand from Kronach
to Coburg&mdash;15 miles. This is not quick enough. You
have not placed a service of despatch-riders as I told you
to do.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the Ulm campaign despatches were sent through
at regular intervals from Murat’s column of cavalry
in the Black Forest to Napoleon many miles away on
his left, but this work was usually performed by
officers riding despatch.</p>

<h3>TRACKING, ETC.</h3>

<p>Nearly all men brought up in the country have
a certain instinct, and habitually read the story of
tracks on the ground wherever they go, but the
remainder require a considerable amount of training
not to ride over the most obvious tracks without any
observation and deduction. A few lessons of following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
tracks in the early morning after a wet night
across country and along roads will tend to establish
this very necessary habit in a cavalry soldier, and
once acquired, it will last him a lifetime.</p>

<p>The institution of regimental scouts has gone far
to train our troops in all these forms of useful knowledge,
and where commanding officers make a point
of passing all those who are likely to come on for
promotion to N.C.O.’s, through the scouts’ course, the
advance of the regiment in a most useful, but not
very showy, accomplishment has been most marked.
In all this form of instruction it is well worth while
to make the schemes interesting and even romantic,
and let them run to a conclusion which depends
largely on the cunning and ability of the officers and
men engaged.</p>

<p>There can surely be few more marked successes in
the efforts of the nation to “return to the wild” in
the body, whilst raising the mind to the higher levels,
than the institution of “Boy Scouts,” and it is one
which every genuine soldier must heartily welcome.</p>

<p>In all detached work where the cavalryman is
engaged “on his own” against well-armed men, far
more dangerous antagonists than any wild animals,
there usually comes a time when prudence calls loudly
to the ordinary man to turn and so avoid the chance
of a bullet, whilst duty tells him that he should try
and see or find out more. There is no reward in
sight, there are no onlookers to applaud, there is none
of the retriever dog’s instinct to save, which leads
men to sacrifice their life in pulling out a comrade;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
there may be a love for excitement and taking chances,
but it is soon dulled by frequent experiences, or there
may be the callousness resulting from daily risk. It is
at these times that the previous training and bringing
up, the tone of his corps and comrades, and the
thought that he has a duty to those comrades, may
have a good deal to say to a man alone with his
duty.</p>

<p>The sneering, niggling cynic will calculate, “What
reward is there for this?” and go back ready to lie,
whilst the honest soldier will go forward ready to
take his medicine, even if he feels the anticipatory
pain about the third button of the waistcoat. That
was the right sort of man, who, when chaffed by a
comrade for his evident trepidation, replied, “Yes,
and if you were half as much afraid as I am, you
would run away.” It is the reasoned four-o’clock-in-the-morning
courage, determination, and honesty,
backed by a trained knowledge of his duty, that
is needed when the cavalry soldier is on detached
work.</p>

<h3>PRISONERS</h3>

<p>To make prisoners is often one of the most important
means of obtaining information. Prisoners
almost invariably will give information quite willingly.
Incidentally this is a point which should be known
to all cavalry officers, who should constantly warn
their men: first, that they are certain to be cleverly
questioned if taken prisoner; second, if that fails,
they will probably be placed where pretended prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
of war can hear their conversation, and so on; third,
threats and inducements will be made use of.</p>

<h3>CONVOY DUTY</h3>

<p>This is work for which a detachment of cavalry is
frequently told off to do the advanced, flank, and rear
guards. In order to save the horses, it will be found
best to divide the respective forces and work <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en
bondes</i>, moving quickly over open ground, and getting
into successive positions where cover is available. In
each of these a rest, and possibly a mouthful of grass,
will serve to keep the horses fresh.</p>

<p>Nothing is more annoying to a column commander,
who has regard for his horses, than to see one of his
mounted men using his horse as an easy-chair whilst
delay takes place at some difficult crossing. Strict
orders are necessary in this matter. Many a time
have we seen an irascible commanding officer ride up
behind one of these spectators and jerk him violently
off his horse.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place here to say that an
escort to a convoy should invariably be at least twice
the strength of any force which is likely to attack it.
The handicap of being tied to a convoy following
a certain route and supplying detachments for
advanced and flank guards and of fighting on ground
of the enemy’s choosing, etc., necessitates this, if
safety is desired. Small parties of horsemen should
be sent on, wide of and parallel to the road, to get
touch of the enemy; the principle of separating the
rôle of information and security is thus adhered to.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="subhead">RAIDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">The very idea of a cavalry raid is attractive and
carries with it a certain romance.</p>

<p>It is impossible to do otherwise than admire the
boldness of the conception of Stuart’s raid in 1862,
when, with 1200 men and two guns, he rode right
round the Federal lines, alarmed McClellan, and
caused him to withdraw troops to cover his line of
cavalry and thus weaken his first line. Yet even
this raid, brilliant as it was and tactically successful,
is said to be strategically a mistake. For, to quote
General Alexander’s <cite>American Civil War</cite>, it
“seriously alarmed McClellan for his rear. But
for it the probabilities are he would never have
given the subject any thought, and he certainly
would not have been prepared with a fleet of loaded
transports on hand when he was, soon after, forced
to change his base to Harrison’s landing on the
James River.... On the whole, therefore, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">éclat</i>
of our brilliant raid lost us much more than its results
were worth. Where important strategy is on foot,
too great care can scarcely be used to avoid making
any such powerful suggestion to the enemy as resulted
in this case.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Similarly the raid in 1863, by the same general,
had disastrous results for the Confederates. Lee was
then preparing for his campaign north of the Potomac.
Stuart proposed moving with the cavalry in between
the Federal army and Washington, and rejoining
the main army when north of the Potomac. Lee,
unfortunately, sanctioned it, and Stuart set out on
the 24th June, did some minor damage to the
Federals, but lost Lee, not rejoining him till late in
the afternoon of the 2nd July, the second day of the
battle of Gettysburg. Had Lee had his cavalry with
him, that campaign might have had a very different
ending. Therefore, in this case, the timing of the
raid was wrong, and of benefit only to the enemy.</p>

<p>The value of Gourko’s raid across the Balkans in
July 1877, when in eight days he carried dismay
into the heart of Turkey, destroyed parts of the
railroad and telegraph on the principal lines, and
gained a great deal of information as to Turkish
movements, appears to be undoubted. His force,
however, was not entirely a cavalry one.</p>

<p>Coming to a more recent date, in the Manchurian
War, the Japanese, only a few days before the battle
of Mukden, by means of an undertaking against the
rear of the Russians, which was carried out by two
Japanese squadrons (280 men), marching as quickly
as possible by night and hiding by day, succeeded
in reaching an important railway bridge 200 kilometres
north of Tieh-ling and in rear of the Russians. The
troops covering the bridge were surprised at night,
and their attention was thus drawn away from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
the bridge, which a skilfully-led patrol succeeded in
blowing up. The railway service was interrupted for
several days. A regular panic set in among the
Russian Headquarter Staff. The immediate result
was that 8000 Russian troops were diverted for the
defence of the line and were unable to take part in
the decisive battle at Mukden: an instance of most
admirable timing of a raid.</p>

<p>It is true that cavalry raids may disorganize the
lines of communication “which in the case of large
armies,” as Bernhardi says, “have increased in importance.”
But, on the other hand, we must remember
that well-organized lines of communication are now
almost invariably railways. On these there is a most
efficient engineer service, with a breakdown train and
gang of trained road-layers and menders always
ready. These are able to mend a railway in approximately
the same time that it takes to break it up.
It is only badly organized lines of communication
which are really vulnerable,&mdash;though we must not
forget that the blowing up of a French bridge near
the frontier in 1870, during the siege of Paris, very
nearly caused the siege to be raised.</p>

<p>The pages of De Brack’s <cite>Light Cavalry Outposts</cite>
are full of instances of successful raids, those of
which Curély was the hero being specially attractive
and effective.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> In our own knowledge are the raids of
De Wet and others on our line of communication in
South Africa, which entailed a large number of troops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
being allotted to the defence of the railway; whilst
little less effective were the operations of our columns
against the Boers when, hiding by day and riding
by night, they swooped down upon the Boers and
captured their herds of cattle and horses. The Boers
suffered little inconvenience from those columns
which had not recourse to methods combining speed
with avoidance of observation, and with secrecy in
their preparation.</p>

<p>All these operations are obviously those which
are favoured by “conditions of sparsely-settled
terrain and very partially-developed telegraphic
communication, and few roads and railways,” and
the success of many of the American raids forms no
basis for the assumption, so often made, that equal
results would attend their employment in Europe
outside Russia.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>The other side of the question may be seen in
some of the unsuccessful raids entered upon by both
sides in the American War, when raids became “the
fashion”&mdash;raids, which were not only unsuccessful, but
which even had the effect of depriving their own side
of their cavalry at a most important juncture, quite
apart from the number of cavalry horses rendered
useless.</p>

<p>A typical instance of this is seen in Wheeler’s raid
on the Federal lines of communications. When beaten
off at Dalton he made his way into East Tennessee;
his subsequent operations in that region had no
effect upon the fortune of the two armies battling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
round Atlanta. Hood, deprived of Wheeler’s cavalry&mdash;“the
eyes of his army”&mdash;found himself in the dark
as to Sherman’s movements. On the evening of the
27th he jumped hastily to the conclusion that
Wheeler’s raid had been successful, and that Sherman’s
army was retiring from lack of supplies to the
other side of the Chattahoochee. For forty-eight
hours he adhered to this strange delusion, and by that
time the Federals had gained a position from which
it was impossible to dislodge them.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>Quite without permanent result were the big
raids by De Wet into the Cape Colony and by Botha
into Natal, both of which caused the loss of many
overridden horses, and had a bad moral effect on
the Boers, who were hunted from pillar to post;
but the attack on our mule transport in rear of the
columns moving on Kimberley and Paardeberg
was an excellent piece of work and far-reaching in
its effect.</p>

<p>Again, the Russian raids against the Japanese were
strangely unfortunate in their results, but it is
probable that sufficient secrecy was not observed
prior to these raids moving off.</p>

<p>Taking Mischenko’s raid or reconnaissance into
Northern Korea early in the Russo-Japanese War as
an instance, it is interesting to see the manner, first,
in which it was met by the Japanese; second, in which
it allowed itself to be distracted from the main object.
This raid was sent to find out what force of Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
was in front of the Russians, and, arriving at Chon
Chou at 11 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, “tumbled upon” a town garrison,
deployed five sotnias in all, keeping one in reserve,
thus voluntarily renouncing its mobility to attack a
town. The result might have been foretold. The
force was held in front by two squadrons dismounted
and attacked by one squadron mounted on the flank,
meanwhile a Japanese infantry battalion is brought
up at the double. Result: retirement of the
Russians, reconnaissance practically valueless.</p>

<p>In the case of General Mischenko’s long ride to
Yinkov with fifty-three sotnias of Cossacks, four
commandos of mounted scouts, twenty-two guns, and
four machine guns, the primary object of the raid,
and a notable one, was to interrupt the junction of
the Japanese troops, freed by the fall of Port Arthur,
with those on the Shaho, a quite secondary objective
being the stores at Yinkov. 1500 pack-horses
accompanied the column. 30 kilometres were
covered in two days. On the third day the garrisons
of Hai-cheng (1500) and Ta-shih-chiao, somewhat
larger (the distance between these towns being 20
miles), sufficed to turn the leader of 9000 cavalry
from his first objective, and to send him towards
Yinkov. Here he dismounted sixteen sotnias for a
night attack, but, meeting with wire entanglements
and a vigorous resistance, retired.</p>

<p>Nothing had been effected.</p>

<p>Rennenkampf’s reconnaissance on the 9th May to
Kuan-tien-cheng. Force at his disposal one battalion,
ten sotnias, and eight guns. We read that, making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
“two very trying marches,” he reaches Kuan-tien-cheng
with six sotnias. “The remainder of the
detachment had been left behind at various points on
the line of communication, partly on account of the
exhaustion of the men and horses, partly to secure
its line of retreat. As the march had been carried
out without any regard to the pace of the various
arms, the detachment was completely scattered.” A
Japanese force of 400 infantry left the town, but
shortly returned reinforced by a battalion, which unexpectedly
attacked and drove the Russians away.
The result of the reconnaissance was nil. And so
on.... Rennenkampf was indefatigable. But the
work “though so fruitless had exhausted the sotnias,
which were now considerably under strength, and most
of the horses had sore backs,” and so it will always
be. Those who have seen the state of men and horses
after four, three, or even two nights in the saddle will
not need assurance on this subject.</p>

<p>Von Pelet Narbonne puts down the general failure
of Russian raids to the small value of the Cossacks,
who were not trained in offensive dismounted action,
nor possessed with a keen desire to use the sword.
He then compares the method of the Japanese,
whose tactics were more suited in his opinion
to the intricate and mountainous nature of the
country. They sent infantry with their cavalry,
who carried out the unavoidable reconnaissance
combat. This method certainly economized the
cavalry, an arm in which the Japanese were very
deficient. Again, the Japanese cavalry frequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
met the Russian cavalry by dismounted fire from
the mud walls of villages, and were mistaken by
them for infantry.</p>

<p>What, then, are the general conclusions at which
we arrive?&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. That big raids seldom have results which
justify the loss and wear and tear of the horses and
men.</p>

<p>2nd. That a raid must not be entered upon except
with a special and adequate purpose and as a
result of careful reconnaissance by spies and others.</p>

<p>3rd. That once entered upon, the leader must
devote himself to carrying out his mission and not
allow himself to be turned aside on any account
whatever.</p>

<p>4th. That a small, swift, well-hidden raid on a
line of communication made at a favourable moment
may cause the detachment of a large number of
troops, whose absence will be felt in the decisive
battle.</p>

<p>5th. That raids against which the enemy has made
preparations are purposeless, but are nevertheless
often made by cavalry leaders, lest they should incur
the reproach of having done nothing.</p>

<p>6th. That the first raids in a war are often
successful.</p>

<p>7th. That a friendly country favours raids, and
conversely an enemy’s country renders them difficult
to the verge of impracticability.</p>

<p>8th. That cavalry should not be sent off on raids
when required for action on a battlefield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
9th. That a raid is like any other detachment, <i>i.e.</i>
if it succeeds in drawing away from the decisive
point at the right time a stronger force than itself,
it is justified; and therefore the chief point to
consider in planning a raid is its timing.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TRAINING OF THE CAVALRY OFFICER</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“However much thou art read in theory, if thou hast no practice
thou art ignorant. He is neither a sage philosopher nor an acute
divine, but a beast of burden with a load of books. How can that
brainless head know or comprehend whether he carries on his back a
library or bundle of faggots?”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sadi</span>, <cite>Gulistan</cite>, p. 273.</p></blockquote>

<p>As each year passes it appears to be more difficult to
get officers for the cavalry, consequently any attempt
to state what is the best way to train them is always
subject to the proviso of the old-time cookery-book,
“First catch your hare.” We all know the type of
officer required, but we are also aware how hard it is
to get him. He has been described over and over
again, and can be seen in any cavalry regiment; a
man who combines an addiction to, and some knowledge
of, field sports, involving horses, with sufficient
intelligence to pass into Sandhurst. In order to catch
this hare, mess expenses in cavalry have been reduced
to a minimum. He is given chargers by Government;
they are hired by him if used for other than
military purposes, but otherwise they are not paid for.
Uniform has been made less expensive. Finally,
examinations have been relaxed, though certainly an
increase of pay has not yet been tried. And still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
parents and guardians hesitate to send their sons
into a service which affords a better training and
discipline of mind, body, and manners for the first
few years, than is available in any other profession.</p>

<p>Extravagances in the old days have frightened
candidates for cavalry commissions away. The
more irresponsible press write against the Cavalry.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
Fewer country gentlemen can afford the requisite
allowance to their sons.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> Expenditure all round
has increased, whilst incomes, at any rate those
derived from land, have shrunk. More youngsters
go abroad to the colonies. “How hardly shall
the rich man enter” the barrack gate now, when so
much more work is to be done!<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> All honour to him
when he does so, and sticks to his profession. Hard
work, danger, adversity are the making of a man,
and those who fear or shirk such are not likely to
make good cavalry officers, or, for the matter of that,
good citizens of the Empire. A short comparison of
the life of the cavalry officer thirty to forty years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
ago and nowadays may elucidate this to some
extent.</p>

<p>Then, as a rule, throughout the winter one parade
per week, a horse parade on Saturday, took place.
The officer who could afford to do so could hunt every
day in the week as long as he went round his stables
once during the day. Only the orderly officer (and
often his belt was taken by the adjutant, or riding
master, or a sergeant-major in the winter) remained
in barracks. Sometimes there appeared in orders for
Saturday: “Riding School for officers not hunting.”
In the summer there were no manœuvres, and only
in very exceptional cases was there brigade training.
A regimental parade under the C.O. once a week. An
adjutant’s drill (only officers junior to the adjutant
being present) once a week. All training of men,
and they were of longer service then, was done by
the adjutant and regimental drill instructors; men
and horses were handed over, theoretically ready for
the ranks, to the troop officer. To sum up, then, the
pay was nominal, and the enforced work was ditto.</p>

<p>Nowadays young officers begin work at daybreak
and go on till midday, 1 o’clock, or perhaps till 3 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>
The squadron officer is now training a succession of
men for the Reserve. There is winter training, then
squadron training, regimental, brigade, and possibly
divisional training. The men are trained to a much
higher standard, and they are trained now by the
squadron officers and not by the adjutant and his staff.</p>

<p>The nation, supremely ignorant in regard to the
detail of military matters, hardly appreciates the fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
(i.) that nowadays a cavalry officer does at least
twice as much work as he did formerly, and (ii.) that
the cavalry officer not only devotes his life to a
patriotic idea, but must also devote a large portion of
his income, at least £200 to £300 a year, to the same
purpose.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> (iii.) The emoluments which he derives
from the public purse are, if anything, less nowadays
than a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>The old type of cavalry officer, who joined the
service for the amusement to be derived from it, is
scarcer; but still he is to be found, and he faces hard
work cheerfully and well. Against the discouraging
influences, and the worst of these is “worry” substituted
for “work,” he has his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> and a
fondness for the life, which is an open-air one, and
in many respects an interesting one.</p>

<p>For the first few years or so of his service an
excess of book knowledge is not required, but it is
desirable that the young cavalry officer should be
able to express himself clearly in words or on paper,
and this he must gain by thinking clearly. Let
us consider his duties in those first years, and
then we shall see what to teach him. The principle
has always been maintained that it is right to work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
him hard when he first joins, and later he can drop
into the pace of the remainder. You must teach him
to ride and to train a horse. A few officers can do
this when they join, and think they are fit to pass out
of the riding school at once. But this is not the case;
they have next to learn to teach others. Again, he
must learn to shoot. He must learn to groom and
shoe a horse, and to apply simple remedies. He
must learn the few main rules of tactics, reconnaissance,
and scouting. He must learn cavalry pioneering.
He must learn to use his personal weapon
on foot and horseback. All these he must learn, not
merely so that he is able to do them himself, but so
that he may be able to instruct and be an example to
others. He will be taught the care of his men’s
health in barracks and on service. He may even be
taught book-keeping, and he will certainly learn something
of house economy on the mess committee.</p>

<p>But the high-spirited youngster whom we want,
and who can leave the service when he wants to, must
in some respects be treated like a blood horse, whom
we feel we can guide, but cannot stop at a single
stride’s notice, as we could a temperate old horse.
We must preserve his verve and desire to take the
initiative, even if it occasionally leads him to do
wrong, when we should remember the great legal
maxim, “If the heart is right,” and also our own
youthful days.</p>

<p>The addiction to manly, and especially to rough
and dangerous, field sports must be regarded as an
immense asset towards efficiency for war. Time spent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
in the chase, “the image of war,” must not be regarded
as so many hours less given to his employer by the
cavalry officer. We particularly want the hunting
breed of man, because he goes into danger for the
love of it.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> He must also be able to perform any of
the diverse duties which he may be called on to
carry out on service, such as to fortify a village,
construct a pontoon, court-martial a prisoner, and
so on.</p>

<p>It is very desirable that he should have as much
as possible practically taught to him. A knowledge of
the tactics of the other arms should be gained thus,
and we are responsible for giving the opportunities,
since this will not and cannot be learnt theoretically;
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">verb. sap.</i> Officers, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">faute de mieux</i>, should be sent
to infantry camps and artillery practice camps, not
to gun and company drill. This attachment to other
arms is carried out by some nations, and especially
France, to a far greater extent than in our service.
It is invaluable in breaking down the watertight
compartment system of training, and in establishing a
closer union of arms.</p>

<p>The elements of strategy should also be taught.
A few good lectures by an officer who has a taste for
this will teach more than a six months’ poring over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
books, for which during his first three years a young
officer has little time to spare. At the same time the
genuine soldier cannot but be interested in questions
of strategy. A knowledge of it gives an entirely new
aspect to what might otherwise appear rather dull
history.</p>

<p>Then you may say that after three years of this
“our young officer is complete and a valuable asset”?</p>

<p>“Far from it.”</p>

<p>“But what more can be asked of him? This
covers the complete syllabus, appendices, etc., etc.”</p>

<p>“There is one thing without which all this is as
‘that which profiteth not.’”</p>

<p>“And that is?”</p>

<p>“He must have a strong sense of <span class="smcap smaller">DUTY</span>, without
which he is ‘as sounding brass or a tinkling
cymbal.’”</p>

<p>Now man is not born with a sense of duty (though
the most riotous young hound often becomes the best
in the pack); it has to be taught; it has to be learnt
practically as well as theoretically; it has to be borne
in on him by precept and example as an excellent, a
noble and a desirable thing, a thing in which to glory.
What is it? The abnegation of self, the working for
the good of all, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in foro conscientiae</i>, and, above all,
without making difficulties.</p>

<p>The French <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Manuel du gradé de cavalerie</cite>, p. 12,
gives the following definition: “Le dévouement, le
sentiment généreux qui pousse l’homme à faire le
sacrifice de sa vie pour le salut de la patrie et de ses
semblables.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
He must learn that the “superiority which disciplined
soldiers show over undisciplined masses is
primarily the consequence of the confidence which
each has in his comrades” (Von der Goltz, <cite>Nation
in Arms</cite>, p. 162).</p>

<p>The young officer begins by having a pride in his
troop, squadron, and regiment, by trying by his own
individual exertions first to make himself fit to lead
and instruct, and next to make his own unit better
than others. If he does not set the example of being
better than others, he will not render much help
to the men serving under him. They will look to
him, admiring what is good in him and despising
what is bad, summing him up, weighing him in mind,
if not in words, as they see him.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> And the eyes of
a regiment see everything. He must be a very
acute dissembler who can escape the five hundred
pairs of eyes which watch him at every turn. This
alone is a good training for any man. Very much
indeed naturally depends on the influences under
which an officer falls on joining a regiment.</p>

<p>A strict but just commanding officer, who works,
but does not worry, the men under him, makes not
only a good regiment, but a regiment which will
fight well in war, whilst a slack and indulgent commanding
officer, even if just, will soon lessen a
regiment’s discipline to an extent which will render it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
of little value in war. In peace, to be sure, no one
takes much notice of this fact, but in war the slack
commanding officer becomes an object of detestation
to all concerned, and he invariably “lets in” every
one. He is most despised by the very men whom
he tries to save from dangers. It is a curious fact in
human nature that usually they think he is doing this
because he himself is afraid.</p>

<p>If, however, there are altogether some four or five
really good officers of various ranks in a regiment,
their influence and peace-activity will save the
regiment from much that even a slack commanding
officer can do to its detriment. All young officers
fall under their influence, and there remains a
substratum of rock under the shifting sands.</p>

<p>Von der Goltz says (<cite>Nation in Arms</cite>, p. 144):
“Every regiment brings into the field a certain
character of its own.” That character depends on its
officers&mdash;often on one officer long since dead and gone.
In one regiment the shoeing was remarkably good; it
transpired that a former colonel, a martinet dead
thirty years before, used to “break” the farrier if a
horse lost a shoe in the field.</p>

<p>With his duties and his sports, for the first two or
three years in a good regiment, the subaltern has no
time to think, and if he is the right man in the right
place, enjoys himself thoroughly.</p>

<p>Let us now hark forrard to the full-fledged cavalry
officer of three to seven years’ service who is learning
to command a squadron, and may find himself doing
so often enough. He has now time to look round,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
and much depends again on the tone of the regiment
and the man himself whether he takes to his profession
seriously or “soldiers” on to pass the time
pleasantly. He may aspire to be a staff officer, or a
good regimental officer, or may have no aspirations.</p>

<p>With the staff officer we are not concerned; what
we are now considering is, What process will render
the regimental cavalry officer of most value to the
service? Constant drills and parades will not do so;
they belong to the past. To put first spit and polish
and show parades is a thing of the past in nearly all
minds. But this must not be taken to mean that drill
is not necessary. Those who have led in war drilled
and undrilled men aver, with reason, that smooth, easy
working and confident leading only exist where the
men have been carefully drilled. A good deal can be
done at a slow, go-as-you-please pace with semi-drilled
intelligent men, but they have no chance, especially in
cases of emergency, against men of lower intelligence,
well trained by the officer who leads them. Drill in
the evolutions necessary in the field is consequently
essential to a high standard of fighting ability. To
drill well largely resolves itself into the power to
observe and correct faults in such a way that the
impression remains. The experienced drill and the
coach of a racing eight know by experience that, owing
to the imperfections of man’s nature, they are bound
to meet with certain faults which will have an unsteadying
and deterrent effect on the squadron’s or
boat’s progress. They address themselves to the
correction of these characteristic faults, explaining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
their reasons, often affecting decorative, if forceful
epithets, similes, and expressions, just as a preacher
or orator does, in order to give point and pungency
to his discourse and to make it remembered. Von
Schmidt in his <cite>Cavalry Instructions</cite> usually details
at the end of each paragraph bearing on an evolution
or practice their characteristic faults, and the cause,
effect, and cure of these. Primed with a knowledge
of these, and possessed of some small power of
explanation, the squadron or troop officer will soon
make an astonishing difference in his command’s
power of evolution. Without them, he too often
gropes in the dark.</p>

<p>What we would suggest, then, is to encourage
this officer (i.) constantly to practise the situations
in which he and his men may find themselves in war,
and (ii.) to train and exercise his command so that
it is difficult for circumstances to arise of which they
have not had some previous experience;<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> (iii.) to
practise giving short verbal orders in the saddle
in proper form (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vide</i> <cite>F.S.R.</cite>, Part I.) till it
becomes a second nature, both in himself to give
orders thus, and his command to place those orders in
their mind and act upon them in a logical sequence;
(iv.) to become by practice a person of resource, and
to train his men so that they become “handy men,”
<i>e.g.</i> able to get a waggon up and down a steep slope,
or improvise rafts, etc., or to place a farm in a state
of defence, and to do so quietly and in an orderly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
manner; (v.) to be himself a capable master of his
weapons, and able to instruct intelligently; (vi.) to
know the situations in which a battle on a large scale
may place him, and to be able to foresee what are the
probable opportunities of which he may have to take
advantage, and so to train his men that they will act
with intelligence in such cases.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>Here we must pause whilst we make it plain that
the really stupid man, who has no imagination, makes
a very bad officer for training purposes, because in
peace-time he is quite unable to picture to himself
what does happen in an action. The same unfortunate
trait makes him a bad leader in war,
because he is unable to picture what the enemy will
most probably do in certain cases. In the cavalry
this type of officer has no place, even in the lower
ranks, because the cavalry officer so frequently has to
act by himself, and then the fate of an army may be
dependent on what he sees, or on the information
which he sifts and sends into the chief. As an
infantry officer of the same rank he is more under the
eyes of a commanding officer.</p>

<p>What, then, are the conclusions at which we arrive?</p>

<p>1. That we draw on a class who have not been
used to much brain work.</p>

<p>2. That the young officer should be for choice
country bred, fond of sport, a “trier,” and must
have some private income.</p>

<p>3. That now he works much harder than he used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
to do, at first especially; but the work is, or ought to
be, congenial work. His pay is the same as when
he did little or no work in peace-time. So he is a
practical patriot.</p>

<p>4. That his work consists largely of teaching
others.</p>

<p>5. That many of the attributes which are most
desirable, can be tested by no written examination.</p>

<p>6. That to recognize and do his duty is one of
these. As regards this, much depends on his surroundings
in the regiment which he joins.</p>

<p>7. That a cavalry officer as he gets up to three to
seven years’ service, though he requires little book
learning, requires fairly wide practical knowledge,
also considerable powers of imagination; without
these, his abilities for training his men and for leading
them in war are likely to be defective.</p>

<p>8. Also that the main point which he must regard
in all his training is not only, “Is this a situation in

<p>“War is a business and must be learned like any other profession.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Napoleon.</span></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The attributes which a cavalry officer of the rank of
squadron leader and upwards may to advantage
possess are so many as to defy enumeration; some of
them really possessed in perfection are so rare and
valuable that <em>in war</em> they may even counterbalance
the fact that their owner is barely able to read or write.</p>

<p>It was not without reason that Napoleon said of
Ney: “When a man is as brave as he is, he is worth
his weight in diamonds.”</p>

<p>To cavalry officers of all others are the reflections
of Von der Goltz applicable, when he says: “<em>Restless
activity</em> on the part of the general is the first
condition of connected and rapid action in war”; and
then he details the weakening of troops exposed to
hardships, “exertion, and privations of all kinds,
fatiguing marches, and wet nights in bivouac, cheerfully
endured for a short time, but not for months
together. They damp martial ardour considerably.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
A few privileged natures escape the effect of such
conditions, but not so the mass of men.”</p>

<p>To the officer it is well that it should be known
that, as war goes on, he may expect to find himself
weakening, but, as with any other disease, forewarned
is forearmed.</p>

<p>It is a duty to his country for a cavalry officer in
peace-time to take such exercise in the available
sports of hunting, pig-sticking, polo, big-game shooting,
and other exercises as will keep muscles and
lungs in condition and training, and his nerves in
order. The cavalry officer, and for that matter the
general and staff officer, who seldom gets on a horse
in peace-time, will not suddenly change his nature
in war; on the contrary, the enforced exercise will
knock him up. Long days in the saddle, and nights
spent on the outpost line with an insufficiency of
food, the constant strain of vigilance will tell on most
men, in fact in some degree on all men. But the
officer who knows beforehand that he may expect
his initiative, firmness, zeal, and love for action to
evaporate somewhat after some months or even weeks
of campaigning will be on the look-out. He will
school his mind and countenance in cheerfulness and
lightheartedness before his subordinates:</p>

<p class="in0">He will practise himself in firmly repressing all
grumbling and cynicism, in assiduously performing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
all details of duty, and in constantly caring for the
welfare of his men and horses. “Such independent
persons,” says Emil Reich, “have long since learnt to
stand adversity, to be, as the saying is, ‘good losers.’
This has given England her peculiar tone, her stamina,
her power in adversity.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> With such all will go well,
for war is the region of reality in which there is no
place for shams; but woe betide the regiment where
the senior officers set an example of cynicism,
grumbling, neglect of duty, want of zeal; these faults
become exaggerated in their subordinates till they
result in the worst military crimes and in the disgrace
of the regiment, by a state of indiscipline and
neglect of duty which only the strongest measures
can put right.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>Whatever the value of a senior officer of cavalry
from the point of view of courage, horsemanship,
resolution, and bodily fitness for a campaign, there are
other points to which he should devote attention. Von
Bernhardi (p. 288 of <cite>Cavalry in Future Wars</cite>) says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A comprehensive military education, and at least a
general grasp of the principles of higher strategy, are
essentials for every reconnoitring officer.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Now a field officer of cavalry may find himself
at any time thrown on his own resources, perhaps
cut off from his base, many miles from superior
authority and with several squadrons at his disposal.
His action, its direction and scope, and the information
gained or missed may have the most marked
effect on the course of the operations.</p>

<p>Again, at any period in an engagement the
moment for action may arise; will then an officer,
who is not trained in peace-time to know his duty,
and to act on his own initiative, have the nerve “to
go in,” without waiting for the order which nearly
always comes too late? Settled convictions as to his
duty,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> acquired by previous practice and study of
similar situations in peace, will nerve him to a correct
interpretation of his duty, which may or may not be
to charge. He will remember what was said of so-and-so
who did or did not “go in.” He must be
able to await a favourable opportunity in cold-blooded
calm; and the time for deliberation once over, he
must possess the cool daring to throw relentlessly all
his available forces into battle.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>About the end of the Boer War an officer was
heard to say: “I only learnt one thing at a garrison<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
class which I attended. In a rearguard action my
instructor told me to go lightly out of two positions
and then let the enemy have it hot at the third one,
when they came on with confidence and without
discretion. That tip has been more useful to me
than anything else I ever learnt, and has pulled me
through again and again.”</p>

<p>But besides this a great deal is now to be learnt,
and many ideas gained from the many excellent
military works which are translated into English from
other languages. Thirty years ago, beyond Von
Schmidt and De Brack (certainly the best of their
kind), few foreign works on tactics and the more
recent wars had been translated. Nowadays four are
translated where one was formerly. These give a
better idea of the varied rôle of cavalry on a battlefield;
we get a little farther than the drill of a
squadron or regiment; we can see laid bare the faults
of our cavalry and of their direction in South Africa,
or what was noticed by various military attachés
as regards the shortcomings of cavalry in the
Manchurian or other campaigns. These, read and
noted in an intelligent fashion, and more especially
if later discussed amongst the officers of a regiment
in their application to the work of training a
regiment, are of great value. Perhaps their principal
value is that they enable officers to lay out plans of
action for emergencies, to get what Langlois calls a
doctrine.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> “Without a doctrine,” he says, “text-books<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
are of little avail. Better a doctrine without
text-books than text-books without a doctrine, for
the former was the case in Napoleon’s time.”</p>

<p>And what was Napoleon’s doctrine? Did not
Napoleon beyond all others study <em>moral</em> in its
application to the training of officers and men, and
to the winning of battles? We see it in his selection
of his generals. Ney began as a leader of partisan
forces. Massena was the head of a band of smugglers.
Again, we may note it in the selection of his staff
officers and A.D.C.’s of whom he asked (1st): Is he
lucky? and (2nd): Is he enterprising? It is evident
in his wise distribution of rewards; “I want blood, not
ink,” he remarked to a commanding officer who had
put forward his quartermaster for a decoration. To
another, of whom he had asked the character of a
man who was claiming a reward for well-known acts
of bravery, when the reply was that the man was a
“drunkard and a thief,” he said, “Bah, blood washes
all that away.” We see, then, that his <em>doctrine</em> was
that the man who will shed his blood is the rarest
and most valuable asset in war; and so he, the great
leader and organizer of armies, put it before all
others, and thus he made it the “fashion.” No doubt
Napoleon could have made “ink” the fashion, had
he thought it desirable to do so. Further, he
decorated men on the field of battle, bearing in mind
the maxim: “Bis dat qui cito dat.” Any senior
officer may imitate this excellent practice, by putting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
in his orders, regimental, brigade or otherwise, a
notice of an “Act of Courage,” etc. If this is done
the same evening it has a great effect.</p>

<p>That the Japanese thought of this is evidenced by
the fact that repeatedly in the orders of the day, and
in the proclamations of the army commanders and of
the commander-in-chief, there were references to the
excellent information and reports which reached them
from reconnoitring detachments and patrols, and on
one occasion Marshal Oyama categorically stated that
without the help which had been afforded him by the
cavalry, he would have been groping in the dark in
the measures he was undertaking.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>Those who neglect to think about these matters
soon wear out the patience of the bravest men.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> De
Brack writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Reward, then, above all things the courage of him who
is first in the mêlée, who delivers his blows with coolness
and certainty, who is last in a retreat, who rescues his
officers, his comrades, who captures a standard, who recaptures
artillery, who is never dismayed by bad luck, and
is always ready and willing.... There are several kinds
of courage, but it is courage of the daring and impetuous
kind which wins battles.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our text-books have had little to say about <em>moral</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
and we were apt to take it for granted that all is for
the best in the best of all possible armies, so long has
the question been overlooked. But is that wise?
Should we not know why one regiment will take a
loss of 50 per cent and “go in” next day again cheerfully,
while another loses 10 per cent, and does not
want any more fighting?</p>

<p>Is it not part of the training of the senior officers
of cavalry that they should know the nature of
the infantry combat, that they should grasp the
consumption of reserves and the gradual moral
degradation of the enemy’s infantry, that they should
have studied works such as Colonel Ardant du Picq’s
<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Études du Combat</cite>, which furnish the most thorough
and complete dissection of <em>moral</em> in war?</p>

<p>In a note to one of his chapters on the value
of discipline, Ardant du Picq relates how in the
eighteenth century four British captains “stood off”
when signalled to for help in an attack about to be
made by their admiral. The latter won his fight,
but was mortally wounded. He, however, sent for
the four captains, court-martialled them and had three
hanged at the yard-arm, and the fourth cashiered
before he himself died.</p>

<p>Every leader should know how narrow is the path
which he will tread when in command of troops in a
fight. How essential it is, then, in cricket parlance to
“give no chances.” And it is a great mistake for
young officers to be left in ignorance of the fact that
a good fighting regiment, battery or battalion, yes,
and brigade or division, can only exist where there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
is a high standard of <em>moral</em> and a thorough mutual
understanding that every one will, and must, play the
game, be the risk, difficulty, or odium what it may.</p>

<p>Polo players will tell you that one selfish player
will ruin a team. This is ten times more true in war,
where they will see the selfish polo player skulk, run
away, or let in his commanding officer and the army
in the very first fight he gets into. And cavalry
officers of all ranks must learn in peace that it is
only by practising at all times broad-minded comradeship
not only in their own corps and arm, but with
the other arms, that victory in the field can be
ensured. Let them read and ponder on what a
French general says of our army in South Africa:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Each arm acted on its own.... This comradeship can
only be fostered by daily intercourse in peace.... In
England it exists neither between the different arms nor
between one battalion and another.... Good fellowship
in the fight can only be produced by good fellowship in
time of peace, and the latter results from a <em>life in common</em>.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This ideal is apparently realized in the Japanese
army, where, it is said, “there are no regiments that
have a reputation or a history which is not that of
the whole army. Just as there are no crack corps, so
there is no crack arm. The pay and standard of
education and living of cavalry officers are the same
as those of other branches of the service.”</p>

<p>Our conclusions then must be:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That courage and activity are the most valuable
attributes in the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
2. That these may wane when the body is exposed
to unaccustomed wear and tear, unless this is foreseen
and guarded against.</p>

<p>3. That habits of decision in tactical situations
must be acquired by practice in peace-time.</p>

<p>4. That a doctrine permeating all ranks is essential
to success in war.</p>

<p>5. The doctrine is “<span class="smcap">The Unison of Arms and
the Resolute Offensive</span>.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TRAINING OF A SQUADRON</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>“Soignez les détails, ils ne sont pas sans gloire; c’est le premier
pas qui mène à la victoire.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Frederick the Great.</span></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Pages 104 to 142, <cite>Cavalry Training</cite>, are devoted to
the training of the troop and squadron, and leave
little to be desired as far as they take us. But those
who wish to study the matter more fully, and to
learn some of the “whys and wherefores,” should
read <cite>Instructions for Cavalry</cite>, by the Prussian
General Von Schmidt, of whom it was said, “No
man exercised so great an influence for good on
our arm since the Great King.” His theory was
that “everything that is dull, cannot be easily
understood or is uninteresting must disappear; the
cavalry soldier has less need of this than any one.
With such instruction he is quite useless, for to him
more than to any one else are freshness, life, activity,
mental quickness and vivacity necessary.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> But most
valuable are the glimpses which the book affords us
of the Great King (Frederick) in his rôle as a trainer
of cavalry. How thoroughly he “meant business,”
and how sternly any weakening, wavering, or indiscipline<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
was dealt with under that resolute autocrat,
when not only an army but a nation was “in the
making,” may be seen from the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It was an old and strict order of Frederick the Great
that no cavalry officer should allow himself to be attacked
at the halt; whoever does it should be cashiered.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>In the cavalry of Frederick the Great the squadron
leader was authorized to sabre any <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">éclaireur</i> met riding
at random across the front.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Elliot mentions a further inspiriting regulation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If it is found that any soldier is not doing his duty, or
is wishing to fly, the first officer or sub-officer will pass
his sword through his body.</p></blockquote>

<p>Frederick the Great, familiar with war, readily
grasped the fact that the military discipline necessary
in order to train men in the highest degree for the
act of war must be stern and inexorable. No bank
holiday, please-do-as-you-are-told soldiering for him.
He knew what he wanted, and that time was limited.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On Sundays after divine service the men shall mount,
as His Majesty considers it of the highest importance for
the preservation of the horse that he should be ridden every
day. The horses will then always be in wind, will not be
stiff in the legs, and not get too fat. This His Majesty
has found to be the case with his own horses. He desires
to have horses in working condition, and does not care so
much that they should be fat as that they should be sound
and fit to march and stand fatigue.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It must not be imagined that every officer who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
rides at its head can train or lead a squadron. Those
who can do both in perfection are few and far
between. An apprenticeship of several years under
various good leaders, added to natural ability, good
horsemanship, an eye for country, a thorough sympathy
with both his men and horses, are a few of the
talents required to make a good squadron leader.
But if a regiment is so fortunate as to possess even
one good squadron leader, there will soon be found,
especially among the junior officers, many to imitate
him, and thus one good squadron leader makes
many.</p>

<p>“A,” the good squadron leader, is easily recognized
in the field; he rides well away from his
squadron, confident that they will obey his word or
signal; his squadron know his ruses and plans, and
move smoothly, ready to act at the indicated speed in
any direction signalled by him. They are led covered
from view,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> duly avoiding or overcoming obstacles,
quietly picking their way; the leader is now far to
the front, with his eye on the enemy; his second
in command passes any signals which are made.
Suddenly pace is increased, and the squadron is
galloping along under the crest of the hill, the cover
which they know without an order he wishes them
to utilize; then the troops wheel into line, “direction
the enemy”; a defensive flank is dropped back, or an
offensive flank pushed up; whilst the enemy’s leader,
taken by surprise, is making up his mind, A’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
squadron has drawn swords and is upon him with
a mighty cheer.</p>

<p>“B,” the indifferent squadron leader, nervously
and fretfully jobbing his horse in the mouth, rides
<em>near</em> his squadron, at which he constantly looks back
to see if the men have not already got out of dressing
or committed some fault. Querulously addressing
his second in command or sergeant major, he asks
some foolish question; already he wants some one
to lean on. His squadron moves round from behind
some cover, where he has unwisely placed it, at an
uneven pace, his ill-bitted horses tossing their heads
in pain. Now he executes some movement; but
before it is completed, he has given another order
to “form squadron,” which formation he forthwith
regards with disapprobation from a flank and at
some 20 yards from his squadron. He has no eyes
for the enemy; two patrols have been sent out who
<em>ought</em> to inform him. He gets the information right
enough, but riding, as he is, near his squadron, which
is walking now, he has barely time to give an order
to increase the pace and then “left shoulder” towards
the enemy, who are getting to one flank, before he
notices his swords are not drawn. To get this done
increases the confusion in his squadron.</p>

<p>But enough has been said to show the difference
in cavalry leaders. In a cavalry engagement A’s
squadron will beat B’s nineteen times out of twenty.
B, poor fellow, is a danger to the State, and generally
not happy in his position. No man likes work which
he performs indifferently. Will this kind of leader<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
ever charge unless he receives a direct order to do
so, and even then will it be well done?</p>

<p>Take it all round, any officer who is up to the
business of efficiently training and leading a squadron
must possess qualities which would have rendered
his career a successful one in any walk of life. It
is impossible to enumerate the hundred and one cares,
anxieties, and responsibilities which beset a squadron
commander. But it is a good thing to mention what
he should regard as his guiding stars. They are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Efficiency for war in men and horses.</p>

<p>2. Avoidance of mere samples of efficiency.</p>

<p>3. Constant steps taken to make the soldiers
confident in their power to use their weapons with
deadly effect.</p>

<p>4. To make every trooper self-reliant in danger
or unusual circumstances, especially when alone.</p>

<p>5. To cultivate the offensive spirit and a determination
to get at the enemy somehow.</p>

<p>1. Efficiency for war in men and horses. Men
not worked hard in peace-time are quite useless in
war, where they have the added privation of want of
food and sleep. Active service is quite unlike peace
service; in the latter a man often spends but an
hour or two in the open and most of the rest of the
day in grooming and cleaning up; these duties are,
generally speaking, a pure waste of time, as far as
cavalry is concerned, in war. Too much of this
barrack-square soldiering is apt to unfit men and
make them slack and tired after a long day’s work,
of which gillies, herdsmen, and keepers would think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
nothing. Few officers are knowledgeable enough
to be able to discern the difference between fit, hard
horses and poor horses. Looking at the horse sideways
on, the ribs may easily deceive one, but following
a horse it is much more easily seen to which category
he belongs. The poor horse is split up and hollow
in the region of the muscles lying alongside the
backbone. Feeling the neck is not a safe criterion&mdash;big
neck muscles may merely mean that the horse
has been fed on the ground; the appearance of the
coat is also fallacious. A sharp canter of a mile
should, however, furnish a good test, as the blowing
and snorting of an untrained squadron and a soapy
lather instead of a clear watery sweat at once tell
their tale.</p>

<p>2. It is a common but most pernicious practice,
instead of making the effort to train all men in the
squadron up to a certain standard of knowledge and
ability, to take some of the smart men and make
them into “show” teams. It is obviously flat-catching
to have a prize team of ten marksmen, whilst
the rest of the squadron are indifferent rifle shots.
A man who wins prizes year after year at tournaments
and assaults-at-arms is not of value unless
he teaches other men. Often he does not do this
for fear they should come on, “until at last the
old man was beaten by the boy.” The best, though
perhaps not the most showy, squadrons are those in
which there is a recognized standard of efficiency in
every exercise and attainment, below which no man
is allowed to fall. The story is told of an inspector-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>general
of cavalry of past days, that, after the usual
inspection, the commanding officer at luncheon said
to him, “I should like you to see my regiment tent-pegging.”
“Certainly,” was the reply. Arrived on
the maidan, about forty men had paraded. “But,”
said the I.G.C., “you asked me to come and see
your <em>regiment</em> tent-peg, and I wish to do so.”
The regiment was forthwith paraded, and the first
squadron’s exhibition was quite sufficient to expose
the fallacy of “samples.”</p>

<p>3. See under heading “<a href="#weapon">the personal weapon</a>” in
chapter on <a href="#training_man">Training of the Man</a>.</p>

<p>4. Self-reliance may be gained by giving the
individual various tasks to carry out by himself and
on his own initiative. The return for this form of
“casting the bread on the waters” is not immediate,
but directly the regiment goes on manœuvres or on
service, the result between a squadron trained on
this system and one where this is not done is most
marked.</p>

<p>The squadron in which every man can read a map
and orient himself (and this is now not exceptional)
moves with perfect confidence on the line marked
out for it, and if “held up” in front at once proceeds
to find a way round or through. Squadrons trained
to this degree may be confidently expected to give
great results when employed with independent
cavalry or as contact squadrons.</p>

<p>From this it will be seen that the education of
the modern working classes has been exploited and
improved upon to a very high degree in the cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
squadron and regimental school. Cavalry work,
which would have been a severe test of map-reading<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>
and troop-leading to a subaltern officer of cavalry
thirty-five years ago, is now within the powers of
every sergeant and corporal, and most of the men.
To attain this has meant hard work for the regimental
officer, and it is doubtful, if the work had not been
largely delegated to the section leader, and thereby
a proper chain of responsibility established, whether
such progress would have been made.</p>

<p>Competitions between sections and troops, the
former for choice, work great things in a squadron.
If the minds of sixteen section leaders are all at work
to find out the best way to train a recruit in various
exercises, to feed a horse to the best advantage
with the forage available, to get the best shooting
average, and so on, it is obvious that the squadron
leader has a good chance of disseminating his
knowledge, when found out, through his squadron,
whilst an interest is given to the work which is
perfectly invaluable. Certainly men, who have to
go through four or five months’ hot weather in the
plains of India with the thermometer occasionally at
115° in the verandah, want these mental exercises
and interests just as they want games of hockey,
cricket, and football in the evening to keep them
sound in wind, limb, and mind.</p>

<p>In every respect competition is a healthy lever
in training; only quite recently a squadron which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mirabile dictu</i>, stopped all smoking for some weeks
before shooting, were successful in winning an army
rifle competition. Above all things, it acts in putting
a stop to the waste of time which is so frequent an
occurrence, where there is no spur to prevent it. It is
distressing to see a troop of men and horses standing
in line, whilst one individual goes through some exercise,
or jumps some fences; a clever squadron leader
will never permit this, he will point out to the troop
or section leader that the remainder would be much
better occupied in “suppling” their horses, or making
cuts and points, till their turn arrived:<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> and that
there is no reason why they should not light a pipe
meanwhile. These amenities make things go easier.</p>

<p>Again, when on the march, or going to or returning
from a field day, by means of judging distance on
prominent objects (to be checked afterwards from
the map), or by noticing the features of the country
and subsequently answering questions on them, or by
guessing what is on the other side of a hill, habits of
observation which are invaluable in a cavalryman may
be inculcated. This last is a capital exercise, and one
which the Duke of Wellington practised. It is related
that he was posting with a friend, and they passed the
time in guessing what was behind the next hill. His
friend remarked how often he was right in his
guesses. Wellington replied, “Well, it is what I
have been practising all my life.” This instruction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
is best delegated to section leaders, since a squadron,
or even troop, is too unwieldy for this kind of education,
which is specially one which should aim at bringing
the slower and more stupid men up to a good level.
The Germans rightly lay the greatest stress on the
fact that collective perfection is only attainable by
individual excellence, and this can only be obtained
by individual instruction.</p>

<p>It is not in the brigade nor even in the regiment
that dismounted work can be taught, but it is there
that the effects can be seen. It is in the troop and
the squadron that men should be taught to be
quick, not hurried, in getting on and off their horses,
and it must be done without the old-fashioned
caution in the navy, “Five-and-twenty for the last
man up the rigging.”</p>

<p>A brigade is manœuvring against an enemy; a
house, a garden, a clump of trees is seen, which, if
seized and held by rifle fire, will prove a most
valuable pivot of manœuvre. A squadron is ordered
to seize it. Now is the time to see whether men
have been taught their work in the squadron. Are
they awkward in getting off their horses? Is there
delay in handing over the horses to the Nos. 3? Is
there uncertainty what to do with the lances? Are
proper precautions taken? If the men have been
well taught, they will be ready to meet with fire
the opposing squadrons sent to seize it. And
further, when the meeting between the brigades
takes place, a well-trained squadron will have had
time to mount again, and will be on the spot to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
throw in a flank attack, which may decide the fight.
The cavalryman must learn that never is the difference
between cavalry and infantry to be observed
more than when cavalry are acting dismounted.</p>

<p>A whole brigade may have to act dismounted.
One not trained in the work will leave its horses
behind and become inferior infantry. If the
squadron training has been well done, they will act
like a swarm of bees, trying here, trying there, everywhere
<em>moral</em> and movement, till the weak spot is
discovered; and then the rush will be made with an
irresistible force in the firing line, and no slow pushing
up of supports and reserves.</p>

<p>We do not wish to see cavalry always getting
off their horses and trying everywhere to shoot their
enemy out of each bit of difficult ground, but neither
do we wish to see a regiment or brigade sitting
helplessly in mass with an infantry or cavalry patrol
holding a defile in front of them, unable to turn them
out because the ground prevents them galloping at it.
Von Bernhardi says:<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Moreover, in the power of holding the balance correctly
between fire and shock, and in the training of the former
never to allow the troops to lose confidence in the latter, lies
the real essence of the cavalry spirit. This, whether it be
in the working out of some great strategical design, or in
joining hands with the other arms to obtain by united fire
action some common purpose, implies a balance of judgment
and absence of prejudice of the rarest occurrence in normal
natures.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
The practical problems, which invariably follow
upon contact with the enemy, placed before his
subalterns, unexpectedly for choice, by means of
flags or real troops, and their proposed solutions,
actually carried out, and then followed by a discussion,
constitute the best and most useful work done by a
squadron leader. If his imagination fails him, he
must read up instances. Nor should he forget to
give them problems which are what would be called
unfair in a test examination, because the odds are too
great, or the situation too difficult. He can and
should explain this later, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">coram populo</i>, but meantime
it is just such problems which come to try the
cavalry officer most highly. For if he is doing his
duty he must constantly find himself in scrapes, and
what our ancestors called “outfalls,” in which the life
and liberty of his men, and more, victory and honour,
depend on his action. Often enough a rapid dispersal
with a prearranged rendezvous is the only rational
course and alternative to defeat or heavy and useless
loss. Again, a bold front shown or a feint at attack
may give time to warn others or to get to cover.</p>

<p>These problems come as too much of a surprise
in war for the ordinary individual, unless he has
acquired character and a large degree of confidence
by frequent exercises in peace-time such as those
indicated above. But, thus equipped, and steeled,
as it were, by a doctrine of resolution, the officer
or non-commissioned officer will perhaps call to his
mind some saying such as “a mounted man and a
shower of rain can get through anywhere.” In an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
instant he has drawn swords, indicated, first, the line
of attack, and second, the rendezvous after dispersal,
then with a cheer or view-holloa he goes at
them. His bold and rapid course of action pulls him
through with little or no loss.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> The Japanese <cite>Cavalry
Training</cite>, p. 57, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From commander to privates all cavalry soldiers must
be accustomed to act on their own initiative throughout
the various trainings and instruction, and in all cases should
observe the following rule:</p>

<p class="center">
Attack&mdash;but do not be attacked.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Problems can be found in the support of mounted
attacks by fire, dismounted attacks, rearguard actions,
the defence or attack of positions taken up in farms
or kopjes by flankguards or rearguards, feints made
to draw the enemy or distract his attention, the
precautions necessary at a halt to water or when in
bivouac, the scouting of an enemy’s outpost line or
in getting into a position before dawn, the passage
of obstacles and defiles, and so on. Always remember
to vary the ground, conceal the enemy’s numbers,
and insist on decisive action. In practice, in cavalry
matters, the wrong action taken in a resolute fashion is
sometimes preferable to right action arrived at after
vast consideration.</p>

<p>The reflection on our British cavalry made, we
believe, by a cavalry officer, that it was well drilled
but badly instructed for war in 1899, appears to be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
genuine and well-founded one. How to escape it in
future must be our squadron leaders’ chief concern.
Napoleon said: “It is not my genius that suddenly
reveals to me, in secret, what I should say or do in
an unforeseen circumstance. It is reflection, it is
meditation. I always work at dinner, at the theatre;
at night I wake up to work.”</p>

<p>Above all, let us study in our instruction how
best to make <em>moral</em> go hand-in-hand with method;
without this what army can do great things? Have
not civilization, education (conducted on our own
lines), the insidious lessening of animus all conspired
against our soldier’s <em>moral</em> in war? How much
simpler and more effective was the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">modus operandi</i>
of the Zulu Impis clearly enunciated in their
war chant, “If we go forward we conquer, if we
go back we die”; their ruler invariably putting
to death all who returned from an unsuccessful
expedition.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Conclusions</span></h3>

<p>1. That interest must be sustained.</p>

<p>2. That with cavalry above all arms, there is a
need for a very stern discipline.</p>

squadron.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TRAINING OF THE HORSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">We have only to consider the contingencies of service
in the cavalry to come to a conclusion that the officer
or man who begins a campaign on a well-trained
horse has many chances in his favour against him
who enters it riding an indifferently-trained animal;
and no more striking instance of this can be brought
forward than the circumstances of the Prince
Imperial’s death in Zululand. The horse in this
case was ridden by an excellent horseman, but it
was well known to be awkward to mount, with the
result that, when suddenly attacked by a rush of
Zulus, the Prince was unable to mount and get away.</p>

<p>But the chance in the rider’s favour<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> is not the
only consideration; the work which a well-trained,
well-balanced, equably-minded horse will do, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
the accidents of all kinds, leading to disablement
and time spent in the sick lines, which it will itself
avoid and also allow its master to help it to avoid,
are well exemplified in any day s hunting in a rough
country. There is the so-called unlucky horse, who
never goes out without hurting himself or his master.
This unlucky horse is associated in our minds with
a narrow forehead with a bump low down on it, a
rapidly shifting ear, and a small eye showing too
much white.</p>

<p>The really ill-tempered horse is not fit to mount
a cavalryman, whose life may depend on the
behaviour of his horse; though here it must be
confessed that some horses with very bad characters
have been trained by real masters of the art to be
good and reliable animals.</p>

<p>Not long ago the ideal laid down in training a
horse for cavalry work was to make him as “clever
across country as a good hunter, active and handy
as a polo pony, and reliable as a shooting horse.”
Nor is it advisable to lower that ideal. Major Noel
Birch in his excellent book, <cite>Modern Riding</cite>, tells us
“the ideal is an excellent one and seldom impossible
if the training is scientific.”</p>

<p>A lack of imagination prevents the soldier, who
has not undergone the vicissitudes of active service,
from quite grasping the situations which cavalry
work may bring about for him, since, whilst acting
as a scout, any cavalry soldier may be called upon to
engage in personal combat, to swim a rapid river,
again to leave his horse standing alone in the open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
whilst he creeps over a ridge to reconnoitre a valley,
or to ride for his life or freedom over stiff fences or
big ditches. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">À propos</i> of this, a story is related of
Seydlitz. He had been telling Frederick the Great
that a cavalryman should never be taken alive.
One day the King was riding with him over a bridge,
and in order to try and prove him wrong, gave an
order to the advanced guard to face about and close
one end of the bridge, and to the next files coming
on similarly to close the other end. He then asked
Seydlitz what he would do now. Seydlitz put his
horse at the parapet and leapt over it into the stream.
This was a high trial for the manners of the horse as
well as the determination of the man.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly a good swordsman on a perfectly
trained horse should account for any three men
of ordinary ability mounted on average horses.
Napoleon said that “two mamelukes could make
head against three French cavalrymen, but that one
thousand French cuirassiers could easily beat fifteen
hundred mamelukes.” One showed high individual
training of man and horse in single combat, and the
other collective training as a troop or squadron.
Both are difficult of attainment, and both point to
considerable trouble, forethought, and knowledge on
the part of the trainer.</p>

<p>In the days of the professional soldier the training
of the horse was probably at a higher standard than
at present, because it was made plain to every man’s
mind that a good horse meant honour, profit, and
safety to him. There was, therefore, as much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
competition for a horse which was likely to train
well, and for a trained horse, as there is nowadays for
a finished hunter or polo pony trained on similar lines.</p>

<p>In all ages there have been some men who could do
wonders on horses quite unrideable by others, but the
exceptions are not to the point. We have to consider
how to train horses in a manner suitable to cavalry work.</p>

<p>In the first place, concurrently with his physical
development, a point requiring the closest attention,
the squadron horse must be trained to
answer to certain conventional aids, so that any
man in the squadron who applies these will find
the horse answer implicitly to them. Now, let
any one who wishes to study the aids exhaustively,
and set up a line of conduct in the training of the
horse for himself, turn a fresh young horse loose in
a riding-school or enclosed manège, and keep him on
the move, with a whip, if necessary. Let him note
how the horse bears and uses his head, neck, leg,
forehand, and haunches, as he bends and turns.
The most correct aids are those indications by the
reins, weight of body, legs, whip, and spur which a
rider applies, so as to produce the natural preliminary
attitudes for the flexion, pace, or movement desired.</p>

<p>If the observant horseman follows this line, he
will find that he must make a rule, first, not to apply
unnatural aids, and secondly, not to apply more than
one aid at a time in the early stages of instruction
of either man or horse.</p>

<p>Now take for instance the case of a horse which
turns <em>on his shoulders</em> at a sharp gallop; it will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
noticed that he stops immediately after turning; but
if, on the other hand, he turns <em>on his haunches</em> at
the gallop, it is with a view to going on in his new
direction at the same or a faster pace. Therefore
the rider will do well to collect his horse on the
haunches as he turns at the gallop, if that is the
pace at which he wishes to continue in the new
direction. Whereas if he turns, meaning to stop, he
will pull one&mdash;say the left&mdash;rein, and (in the later stage
of the training) add the aid of the drawn-back left
leg to circle the horse’s quarters round his forehand.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>Such will be the outcome of his observations
on the loose horse in the manège, and following
this system he will fix in his own mind, with the
assistance of the book, a list of natural aids. The
fact is, that nature has taught the horse to act in
such a way as to utilize the mechanism of his head,
neck, body, limbs, and even tail to the greatest
advantage in his movements. We note these and
adapt them to the aids, which we can apply by
means of our mechanical devices, such as the reins,
and by our natural devices, such as the legs and the
weight of the body.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>Habits of long standing have accustomed horsemen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
to apply, often quite unknown to themselves, certain
aids to which their horse answers. They are often
incorrect, slovenly, or not to the best advantage of
horse or man, but their owners are satisfied, and
often with a very inadequate repertoire. But when it
is a question of fighting on horseback, we want to
get a lightning-like system of aids, so that we may
get where the adversary least expects us, or wishes
us to be, and kill him. The man with experience in
riding, a quick eye, a blood-horse under him, which he
himself has trained, can “play with” one or two, or
even three, adversaries who have not these advantages.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly since 1902 steps have been made
towards an improvement in the training of the
squadron horse. There are fewer “shooting stars,” that
is, horses who bolt out of the ranks, and fewer horses
who refuse to leave the ranks; the horses go better
across country, and are, generally speaking, suited
for campaign riding. Under the old Canterbury
system much time was spent with a view to showing
up a good ride of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">haute école</i> animals, whilst the new
system aims at training a horse which will go well
in the ranks, and will be generally useful on a
campaign, either in single combat or for a scout’s
riding, or for work in the ranks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
The horse is now trained a great deal in the open,
whereas under the old system it was trained almost
entirely in a school or manège, and not in the open.
Whilst by no means underrating the value and convenience
of a riding-school, there is little doubt that the
old system made the horse a stupid animal and quite
unable to look after himself or his rider in a rough
country.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> Under the new system the limited intelligence
of the horse is exploited to a considerable degree.</p>

<p>Whilst officers of continental cavalry spend considerably
more time than English officers in the
training of their remounts, this is to some extent
counterbalanced by the opportunities which the
latter have of riding to hounds over difficult country,
pig-sticking, and playing polo. For the mêlée the
latter is a splendid training, whilst the two former
give an officer an eye for country, and a decision in
crossing it, unobtainable in any other fashion.</p>

<p>After estimating the instruction and advantages
gained by cavalry officers taking part in these and
other sports, which are really a preparation for and
the “image of war,” it may be reasonably asserted
that the British Government by no means gets the
worst of the bargain.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
At the same time it is undoubtedly a slur on any
cavalry officer that he should be unable to train a
remount. If he is not a rich man, it is well worth
his while to learn, so as to train his own polo ponies
and hunters. Many officers do so most successfully.
Scores of horses, cast as unruly animals, are, by the
aid of some of our riding-school methods, quickly
brought to hand, and turn out most useful and
temperate hunters or polo ponies. A comparison of
military and civilian horsemanship is not a desirable
theme, but it is surprising how many of the horsemen
of the nation, even those who ride to hounds and
between flags, are profoundly ignorant of all-round
horsemanship and horse-training. The writer recently
counted only four horses, out of some twenty running
in an important race at Punchestown, a right-handed
course, which passed the stand with the right leg
leading. The four who were leading with the right
leg gained at least four or five lengths at the next
fence, which is on the turn.</p>

<p>Very few six-year-old hunters answer to their
rider’s legs, or are really nice horses to ride. A
bending lesson every day for a month in a good
military rough-rider’s hands would do them an
immense amount of good.</p>

<p>One of the recent innovations which has done
most to improving our squadron horses in cross-country
work is the introduction of the free-jumping
lane for remounts: thanks to which horses get used
to jumping, and regard it as fun instead of a penance
accompanied by jabs in the mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Another most important factor in the training of
remounts is the system of long reining. The colonel
of a regiment, in which the horses were particularly
well trained, assured me that he considered this
proficiency was due principally to long reining.
His system was to take a couple of non-commissioned
officers, whom he found were getting too fat, and let
them do all the long reining. When I saw them,
neither of the long reiners were much too fat; both,
from long practice, at often as many as fifteen or
twenty remounts per diem, were such adepts that,
in their hands, the remounts, as yet almost unbacked,
had learnt nearly half their lessons. The
value of this system no doubt depends largely on
the operator. There may be something also in the
adage, “Who drives fat oxen should himself be fat.”
The patient-minded man is an asset in this work.</p>

<p>A suggestion recently made that the reins should
be carried from the bit to a pulley at the highest
point of the pad, and then vertically to another pulley
on the side, and so to the operator’s hands, is full of
common-sense, as it ensures the horse holding his
head right whilst there is control of the hind
quarters.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>A system of giving prizes for the best-trained
remount encourages a very deserving class of man
in cavalry regiments, and evidences to all that the
commanding officer is taking an interest in their
work; the danger is that the men sometimes confuse
circus tricks with legitimate training for campaign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
riding. If the commanding officer gets on the three
or four best-trained horses before awarding the prize,
and generally keeps an eye on the progress of the
remounts in training, it will have a marked effect.</p>

<p>Above all, rough methods, shouting in the riding
school,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> and any attempt to hurry training should be
discouraged; a horse takes a little time to learn in
good hands, but it should be remembered that most of
the gymnastics which he has to learn involve training
muscles and sinews to an unnatural extent, and that
this must be done with a weight on the horse’s back
which nature did not contemplate.</p>

<p>If there is one thing more important than another
in the training of a squadron horse it is that he
should be taught to walk well, quickly, and freely.
By constantly placing the fastest walking horses at the
head of the rides, and teaching the men to ride with
a fairly loose rein, this is soon effected. The result
in a regiment where this has been consistently done
is surprising.</p>

<p>Once placed in the ranks the squadron leader
should not lose sight of the horse, but watch his
career. There is a key to every horse’s mouth, so
it is said; certain it is that, whilst one squadron
commander will see his horses tossing their heads,
poking their noses, and going with their jaws set
against one side of the bit, without in the least
knowing what is the matter, another officer would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
in a short half-hour have loosened the curb there,
adjusted a nose-band or added a martingale here,
and have discovered an injured jaw in two other
cases. For the latter he would order his farrier
to make a carrago nose-band, or would improvise a
string bridle with ten or twelve feet of small cord,
so that the horses could go on with their work.</p>

<p>Let us take an instance, then, of the actual value
to the State of these two squadron commanders. In
one case the horse becomes unmanageable from pain,
develops bolting propensities, injures one or two
riders, and is perhaps cast and sold for £5 as
vicious. The value of the horse (£40 by purchase
at four years’ and £60 for two years’ keep, etc.) is
£100. In the other case the mouth is healed and
the animal does eight or nine years’ good service.
The value to the State of an observant, skilled
horse-manager as compared with an indifferent one
is some £500 per annum. On service this value may
be multiplied by 5 or 10.</p>

<h3>(A) <span class="smcap">Riding</span></h3>

<p>There is no doubt that our methods of teaching
riding have greatly improved of late years.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
recruit is not made afraid of his horse, and of his
work in the riding-school, as he often was under
the old régime. From the day he joins, no
opportunity should be lost of teaching the recruit
that amongst his first duties is to love, honour, and
have a pride in his horse. He certainly will not
recognize this duty, if, as under the old “cast-iron”
system, his horse becomes the means of applying an
unpleasant discipline to him.</p>

<p>Further, he is now taught to ride in the open, and
over a natural country in many cases, picking his
own line. In fact he is taught campaign riding,
rather than as formerly the elements of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">haute école</i>;
the latter plan was by no means unsuitable if the
man had the previous knowledge of riding which
many men, brought up in the country, joined with
forty or fifty years ago.</p>

<h3>(B) <span class="smcap">Soldier’s Care of Horses</span></h3>

<p>Of all instructions to be given to the young
soldier the most difficult is that in campaigning
horse-management.</p>

<p>It should be explained that the care of his own
horse in a campaign is quite a different matter in the
cavalry from what it is in the artillery; in the latter
the horses are always under the master’s eye in the
first place, and in the second they are kept at a
uniform pace, whereas in the cavalry men are detached
here and there, and it is only by the individual’s
care of his mount that the latter can win through a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
campaign. In fact the difference is as great as if,
instead of carrying on his business under one roof,
Mr. Whiteley had to send out all his young men and
women in troops and sections and as individuals to
effect sales. It would certainly lead to a very great
diminution of profits, and just as in any great business
the profits are effected by small and seemingly petty
economies, so in a regiment it is the small economies
of horse-flesh which mount up to a great sum in a
month or so of campaigning. It is the regiment or
squadron, in which, from the start, the man has been
taught always to dismount at every opportunity,
always to off-saddle and massage his horse’s back
when a spare quarter of an hour affords him time to
do so, always to give his horse a chance to nibble
the short grass, or drink a few go-downs of water,
always to report without fail a loose clinch or
a swelling on the back, even if the latter is only
the size of a shilling, that will constantly show a
good return of sound horses. A bad system of horse-management
will in a week incapacitate as many
horses from work as will a general engagement.</p>

<p>As a rule great things are expected of cavalry in
the first week of a campaign; these great things are
often to be carried out <em>at all costs</em>&mdash;all costs in this
case meaning in many instances half the horses overridden
and a crop of sore backs<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> and incipient injuries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
incurred which the cavalry will not get over for
months after. There is also another difficult matter
to cope with in the cavalry; it is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The ordinary soldier has no idea of the limit of
his horse’s capacity for work such as that soon gained
by the hunting man or traveller on horseback. In
peace-time he will not once in one thousand times be
given a task which can possibly injure or cause him
to override his horse; further, the latter invariably
gets back to his stable, gets the best of food and a
rest, or goes to the sick lines if he is evidently
out of sorts; the responsibility of overriding his
horse is thus not fixed, and the man escapes any
punishment. As the man is riding a Government
horse and not his own animal, he does not suffer
pecuniarily.</p>

<p>We believe that enough has been shown to
warrant our saying that the cavalry of an army
where (1) a good system of campaigning horse-management<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>
has been instilled into the individual,
and where (2) the officers, from those who order the
task to those who superintend it, have the knowledge
to do so with a sense of the horse’s capacity as
affected by work, food, and drink, weight carried,
nature of terrain, will, at the end of one month’s work,
possibly have lost 15 per cent of its horses; whereas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
in the cavalry where these matters are not understood,
only 15 per cent of the horses will remain available.
What was the case in Napoleon’s invasion of Russia?
A statement called for by the emperor at Witebsk on
the 29th July, twenty-five days after the river Niemen
had been crossed, gave the loss as follows: Murat’s
cavalry<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> reduced from 22,000 to 14,000 horses, the
cavalry of army corps by half, Latour Maubourg’s
from 10,000 to 6000. Later, on the 9th November,
only 1900 horses were left to this immense force of
cavalry. The loss by fatigue in the campaign of Ulm,
lasting little more than a fortnight, was less, 46 per
regiment. One campaign resulted in a victory within
eighteen days, whereas the other went on long enough
to bring the loss and criminal waste of horses home to
those responsible. In campaigns brought to a close in
a few days by desperate though successful strategy,
these matters, like many matters which occur in small
campaigns against natives, never come to notice.</p>

<p>This subject has been gone into at some length
under the training of the man, because without his
co-operation in the individual care of his horse no
cavalry general can hope to be successful. His best-laid
schemes “gang aft agley.” The cavalry soldier
should feel that he will get a horse, good, bad, or
indifferent, accordingly as he shows himself a good,
bad, or indifferent horseman and horsemaster, and
should be made perfectly aware that he will be
punished with the greatest severity for every act of
carelessness, neglect, or ill-treatment of his horse.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Whilst, on the other hand, a well-cared-for horse
should be a certain passport to the good graces of
his leader. A squadron leader, careless of this
mode of procedure, never has good and well-cared-for
horses on service.</p>

<p>A very successful way of teaching the soldier to
care for his horse is to let it form part of the test
before he passes from the recruit stage to that of the
trained soldier, that he should by himself ride his
horse to a place 70 to 100 miles away, report on
some bridge or other topographical feature, and
return, enough money being given him for the
subsistence of himself and his horse for the necessary
number of days&mdash;the condition of the latter being
carefully scrutinized on his return.</p>

<p>Other forms of long-distance rides and patrols (as
distinct from long-distance races, a cruel form of
competition with which no horse-lover can have any
sympathy) are most useful, as they teach the men
how to regulate their paces, spare their horses, and
judge distance by time and pace.</p>

<p>Often arrangements have been made to take some
N.C.O.’s out with the regimental pack of hounds,
local pack, or on a drag-hunt or paper-chase; all these
forms of instruction teach the men to ride fast in a
reasoned fashion and not in the Johnny Gilpin and
“making the running” style of the amateur horseman
or horsewoman, and to think properly of their
horse, and not as the old lady, who said to the coachman,
when he had reported the brougham horse was
lame, “He is a horse and he <em>must go</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
That the care of the horse is the weak link in the
cavalry chain, and the most difficult one in which to
give such instruction as may render it strong and
reliable, is clear. Every day we get fewer men
accustomed before they are recruited, to work with
horses, and the use of the horse as a means of locomotion,
by all ranks in Great Britain, is quickly
dying out. Strong measures are needed to counteract
our daily growing ignorance of horsemastership.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<h3>(C) <span class="smcap">Shooting and Fire Discipline</span></h3>

<p>The cavalry are now armed with a rifle equal to
that of the infantry, and can hold their own in rifle-shooting.
The greatest interest is taken in this
exercise; tests similar in all respects to those in
vogue in the infantry are exacted before the man is
entitled to get his full rate of pay. Practically all
officers and many N.C.O.’s of cavalry now possess
Hythe certificates,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> and there is no reason why fire
discipline in the cavalry should not be equal to that
in the infantry. In many cavalry regiments it undoubtedly
is so. In others there is too much talking
and the Jack ashore kind of behaviour, which renders
difficult the control of the larger parties. If the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
officers recognize that good fire discipline is essential
in order to kill their enemy, they will take more
trouble to instil it. As our cavalry are undoubtedly
the best shooting cavalry in the world, it is a pity to
spoil the ship for this ha’porth of tar (fire discipline).</p>

<h3 id="weapon">(D) <span class="smcap">The Personal Weapon</span></h3>

<p>Fencing and single stick (and other exercises such as
boxing, non-essential in themselves, but which quicken
the eye and make the man cool in combat) will do a
great deal towards teaching men the use of the sword,
while a little tent-pegging and a great deal of work
at the dummies will teach the unrivalled value of the
queen of weapons.</p>

<p>In many cavalry training-grounds can now be
seen an acre of ground in which are a score or more
of self-adjusting dummies of varying heights, and representing
horse and foot; there is no better practice
than to send half-a-dozen horsemen into this tilting
ground at a sharp gallop, and let them practise for the
mêlée for a minute or so.</p>

<p>The French cavalry lay great stress on these
pointing exercises; they do not expect to turn out
many real swordsmen in a squadron, but they want
every man to be able to ride his horse at an enemy,
and run him through.</p>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">E and F</span>) <span class="smcap">Mens sana in corpore sano</span></h3>

<p>In addition to the four headings mentioned
above, there is the preparation requisite to meet the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
hundred-and-one eventualities of detached work and
miscellaneous duties.</p>

<p>Whilst it is quite impossible to foresee or delimitate
these, there are a number of exercises and sports
which tend to make a young man (and keep an old
man) not only supple in his body and sound in wind
and limb, but also alert in mind: to put it shortly,
they make him more “handy,” more able when left
to himself or with a few others to carry out his duty;
they give him more confidence in himself; they
make the town-bred man approximate more to the
pioneer. The ordinary lad of eighteen brought up in
a town knows nothing of the country in which his
soldiering and scouting will be done, and is not able
to do a great many things which a country-bred lad
has learnt as a matter of course. On the other hand,
the town-bred lad is undoubtedly quicker at picking up
and assimilating knowledge. Both have their good
qualities, and both can be made into excellent cavalry
soldiers by training in the particular points in which
they are by breeding deficient.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>Let us now glance at the sports which tend to
make men handy and useful.</p>

<p>Every cavalryman should learn to swim, since,
unless he can do so, he may either not attempt to
cross a swollen river, or he may get drowned in doing
so. Not only this, but he should be able to make his
horse cross a deep and rapid river whether he can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
swim or not himself. Some of us still remember the
disaster to a cavalry regiment when crossing a river on
the frontier.</p>

<p>Many sports and exercises&mdash;to be able to swim, to
row a boat, and so on&mdash;are not essentials in the training
of a cavalryman, but they are very desirable; and
when an opportunity of practising them occurs, every
commanding officer should make his men take advantage
of it.</p>

<p>Again, in the <cite>Manual of Military Engineering</cite>
there is a great deal which may be said to be more
suited to pioneers, and a knowledge of which cannot
be expected from every cavalry soldier. Knotting
and lashing, construction of rafts, scientific
demolitions of railways and telegraph lines come
under this heading. A certain number of men in
each squadron are detailed to act as pioneers, but
since in most cavalry operations there is a very
good chance of these not being available at the
critical moment, it is well that every man should be
brought up to a good standard of knowledge in all
forms of pioneering, rough field fortifications, and
in tapping a wire, blowing up a culvert, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Another point over which too much time must not
be spent, but which is for the benefit of the soldier,
especially in his first few trying days of active service,
is a slight knowledge of cooking, and especially how
to make use of flour; otherwise you may find the
men throwing away the flour because they do not
know how to cook it. The poorer classes in Great
Britain nowadays nearly all buy bread instead of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
making it from flour once a week, on baking day, as
in the old days.</p>

<p>It will obviously be for the good of a regiment or
brigade of cavalry that it should leave its barracks
for a month in the summer, and go for choice to some
seaside place where there is an estuary, and practise
exhaustively the various non-essential items of
instruction indicated above. Such a change of scene
is immensely appreciated by the men, who get very
tired of barrack routine, and it gives the officers
opportunities for instruction which they do not
usually possess in barracks.</p>

<p>New ground is worked over, practice in camping
duties and expedients takes place, and, last of all,
there is time and opportunity to carry out thoroughly
and practically the instruction; there is time for the
men, because they are freed from many duties which
are necessary in barracks, and for the officers,
because they have the whole day before them, and
do not go on leave. If a whole cavalry brigade has
gone to such a camp of instruction, the element of
competition may be introduced in many ways, which
will help to stir the most sluggish. The desire of the
distinction of being the best swimming squadron in
the brigade will make his comrades hurry up many a
slow, inert lout, who could do better if he tried, and
this will, indirectly, cause him to have more confidence
later in himself.</p>

<p>Again, if two rival squadrons are marched down
to a river, and find, a hundred yards apart, for each
squadron a similar amount of rafting and bridging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
material, and instructions are given to them to
prepare means for a small column to cross the river,
the interest excited by the competition will be considerable.
In a case like this marks may be given
for (1) the most thorough arrangements for the
crossing, including orders by the commanding officer;
(2) the best and most workmanlike construction of
boats, rafts, etc.; (3) the speed in carrying out
the work; (4) silence; (5) tidiness, such as, for
instance, all arms, extra clothing, etc., being placed
in an orderly manner, so that they can be resumed, if
necessary, after dark, or at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p>In the sands, usually to be found at any seaside
place, good practice can be gained in digging hasty
field fortifications without the labour involved in
doing so in the stiffer soils.</p>

<p>In the late South African War one might sum up
the situation in a few words: our regular soldiers had
need to be more like colonials, and our colonials more
like regular soldiers. Some of our soldiers lost their
way a mile from camp; our colonials never did this,
but their views of military discipline were curiously
lax. Our soldiers were the victims of routine, and
it cost them their lives often enough; our colonials
could hardly be trusted to lay sufficient stress on an
order to carry it out, but they were never at a loss
for an expedient. Both looked after their own
interests at the expense of the enemy, or even their
own side.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> Both were very brave; both fought and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
scouted cunningly; but it came first and naturally to
the colonial, who gave his enemy credit for slimness,
and had a more cultivated imagination and better
appreciation of the value of ground. In rearguards
both “stuck it out,” if anything, too long, rather
than give the enemy an idea that they could be
hustled.</p>

<p>It is suggested that instruction should never stop
short of the actual and practical. Few educated
people are able to understand how very little words
convey to the ordinary untrained intelligence, and
for how short a time, even if understood, theory is
retained in the mind.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>Anything which is worth learning must be learnt
as a well-known amateur billiard player and game
shot taught himself. In billiards he first placed the
balls again and again till he could make the difficult
cannon; he then went on till he could make it twenty
times running. Similarly, in regard to a difficult kind
of shot, he went to a shooting school and had clay
pigeons shot out in a particular way; at length having
hit, he went on till he practically could not miss.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Theory</span></h3>

<p>The theoretical instruction given by our officers
to the men in lectures benefits, we verily believe, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
former quite as much as the latter. It benefits the
officer, in the first place, because it compels him,
if he is anxious to do his work well, to look up his
subject thoroughly beforehand; and in the second
place, because it accustoms him to speak in public
more readily; and this may be of value not only
to him but to the army and nation later. But
his instruction should not be devoted entirely to
professional subjects. It is a part of his duty to
attend to the education of his subordinates in the
subject of <em>moral</em>, and to develop by every means
in his power their sentiments of bravery, straightforwardness,
confidence in their leaders, and devotion
to duty and patriotism. Without these as a foundation
there are few who will adhere to the requirements
of that discipline, without which, in the
absence of religious fanaticism,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> no difficult task in
war will be carried through. There are sound
grounds for saying that “if we examine the
condition of the people we shall find that <em>moral</em>
deteriorates in inverse proportion to advance in
education.”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> Officers who have to deal with such
conditions must not only know how to teach
thoroughly, minutely, and convincingly, but must
also study all branches of their profession in such
a way that by their intellectual ability they may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
earnestly and loyally interpret the true spirit that
should animate a soldier.</p>

<p>In all the professions, trades, and handicrafts
nowadays, with increased facilities for reading and
book-learning, theory is overriding practice, apprenticeship
is shortened or even dispensed with, the boy of
to-day has read about and thinks he understands
what the man of yesterday has been through and is
still pondering over; and it is chiefly because we see
so much weight being laid on theory, to the detriment
of practice in the profession of arms, that we register
this protest.</p>

<p>That we cavalry have learnt that parrot-like
instruction cannot replace demonstration is evidenced
by our <cite>Method of Instruction in Riding in Cavalry</cite>;
in it we find first “that the instructor, after describing
fully and clearly what he requires, should <em>illustrate</em>
it,” and later, “these instructions <em>carefully illustrated</em>
by the instructor and understood by the recruit,” etc.,
etc. At present in most cavalry regiments each
squadron has a sand table, on which models of
country are made, and map-reading is taught in a
most practical manner.</p>

<p>The more the officers see of the men the better,
and the horse gives an invaluable mutual ground of
interest. We read in <cite>The Truth about Port Arthur</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The battle for these hills was severe, and the coolness of
our men was remarkable. If any of them ran away, or if
any panic set in, it was the fault of the officers, for any
officer whom the men respect and love in peace-time can
rely on their steadiness in war.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>How many Russian officers know and care for their men?
For some reason or other they rarely mix with or among
them, and know nothing of them or their habits, and bitter
are the fruits they reap in war.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This is plain speaking, but it is in accordance with
the dictates of common-sense that the superior and
inferior must become of one mind in order to carry
out their duties adequately.</p>

<p>By whatever means it may be done, it is the duty
of every officer to check cynicism and grumbling
amongst his subordinates, and to develop a high
<em>moral</em>. It has been said that it is the “soldier’s
privilege to grumble.” This is an absolutely wrong
view; it is, instead, his glory not to grumble, but to
face every kind of danger and trouble unflinchingly,
and to make the best of it. Small worries overcome
prepare the mind for facing great emergencies.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>With such a feeling throughout a regiment, what
may it not do? Every man becomes a hero and a
leader. The conduct of 500 heroes may temper the
mind of an army.</p>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Colonel Bonie, speaking of the French cavalry before the war of 1870–71,
says: “In the midst of this indifference war suddenly broke out and
we were obliged to appear on the field with our old ideas and our old
mistakes.”</p></div>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> This is written with the reservation that experience shows that much of
the best and most useful work rendered to an army by its cavalry is never
known and certainly not recorded. The effectual manner in which General
Samsonov, after the battle of Telissu, checked pursuit, held off, and at the
same time kept touch with the Japanese for three weeks or more, is dismissed
in a few lines of history.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> An American, writing in 1899, delivered the following prophecy:
“Cavalry may be an expensive arm to organize, equip, and subsist, but if it
comes to a matter of dollars and cents the security of the British Army in
recent reverses would have been worth a million times what an effective
cavalry screen might have cost. From the moral effect of the recent defeats
the war in South Africa is expected to cost the British Government between
100 million and 300 million dollars.” Later he adds: “Let not our
legislators forget in the coming reorganization of our army the importance, nay
the economy in money and lives which cannot be measured by money, of
maintaining an adequate force of cavalry. Cavalry cannot be made in a
month from militia. The transformation process is slow. Given brave and
fearless men, well-bred horses, expert marksmen, improved arms and
equipments, it is not necessarily cavalry. Training is necessary and
training takes time, but when war begins, time is the one element which is
most in demand.”</p></div>

of artillery or infantry should believe that he and his men cannot be ridden
over so long as they keep steady and in good heart, whilst a cavalry officer
should, on the contrary, believe that he and his men can ride over anything.
These two propositions, speaking in a logical sense, it is impossible to bring

the squadrons, it is said, will be checked by the fire of dismounted men. To

these moderate or at most ordinary shots&mdash;for they are not Boers&mdash;stop a
resolute charge? Will it not be sufficient in any case to dismount a few men

These latter are really responsible for many mistakes unfairly laid at the
door of the cavalry. Cavalry divisions must be allowed a proper liberty
of action, without entirely slipping out of the hands of the commander-in-chief;
whilst the masses of cavalry were formerly kept back to be employed
in reserves or in the pursuit, the tendency now exists to send them forward at
once, on the first day, to a great distance in a certain direction. This, again,
may produce the inconvenience of cavalry being wanting one day when most
urgently required. The despatch of squadrons to the front, and the choice of
the direction in which they are to proceed, must also be in accordance with a
definite plan. Moreover, the commander-in-chief must not only be clear as
to his real intentions, but must also communicate them with perfect clearness
to the cavalry.”

only at ordinary, but also at racing pace, may defy pursuit by one who has
not had the same experience of leaping, and especially of leaping at full
speed, and of the powers of his horse.”

Our British cavalry officers had justly a great reputation for their abilities
in this respect in the Peninsular War.</p></div>

to his column commander, “We did not think there would be anything on
to-day, because you were wearing your slacks and riding the black horse!”

the remark.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_76" href="#FNanchor_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> Note the strong measures which Lasalle, one of Napoleon’s best
cavalry leaders, is said to have taken at Pultusk in 1807. His brigade
was about to attack the Russian artillery, and about 2 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> had hardly
advanced twenty paces before the cry of “Halt!” was heard and at once
passed down the line without any one knowing where it had started. The
two regiments turned and began to retire at a gallop, though the Russian
guns had not fired a shot. Rallied after seven or eight minutes and brought
back, their brigadier-general, in a furious rage, kept them in line until midnight
under the enemy’s fire. So heavy was this that the general had two
horses killed under him. Men and horses fell at every minute, but it is said
not a man stirred, nor was a murmur heard.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Picard.</span></p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_77" href="#FNanchor_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> On one occasion in the operations in South Africa, 1899–1902, a troop,
ordered to gallop a kopje, halted at 700 yards from it, dismounted, and began
to shoot; a troop of a rival corps was at once sent to gallop through them and
did what they had been told to do&mdash;took the kopje; a salutary and effective
lesson.
</p>
<p>
Another time a squadron attacking was held up by wire whilst under fire,
and began to come back; another squadron was led at a gallop through them.
The irresolute squadron at once turned and followed them. The art is to
loose the support at the right moment and with due emphasis.</p></div>

Napoleon’s campaigns, had by 1814 got as far as the command of a regiment,
the 10th Hussars. On the 12th February at Château-Thierry he got an
opportunity, and successfully threw his regiment at the flank of thirty
squadrons of Landwehr. This gave an opportunity to Letort with the
Dragoons of the Guard to charge the front. Napoleon in his bulletin only
put: “Colonel Curély made himself conspicuous”; but he at once promoted
him to the rank of general for this feat of arms.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_91" href="#FNanchor_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> Taking an instance which comes to mind: a troop of cavalry on outpost
duty at Colesberg found themselves cut off at dawn by some 500 Boers;
instantly they rode at the enemy, and, with small loss and doing some
execution with their lances, came out.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_92" href="#FNanchor_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> The cavalry soldier is often required to perform independent duties and
penetrate far into the enemy’s lines under conditions entailing danger and
hardship. He should, therefore, not only be brave, strong, and determined,
but also intelligent, enthusiastic, deliberate, and calm. He must be able to
act on his own initiative in accordance with the orders he receives and the
situation of the moment. His horse is the cavalryman’s best weapon. The
soldier should prize his horse more than his own body, and thus in an
emergency he will be able to rely without fail upon this weapon. It is only
when the foregoing qualities have been acquired by training and experience
in the field that a man can call himself a true cavalry soldier.&mdash;<cite>Japanese,
Cavalry Drill Regulations</cite>, 1907, 44 (trans.).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_93" href="#FNanchor_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> For practical riding, however, turning on the forehand is not advocated.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_94" href="#FNanchor_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> At the same time these natural movements are not all that we demand
of a horse; we must therefore add the proviso that with the weight of a
rider on the horse’s back, some of the natural turns, and twists, and bearings
can be, and need be, improved on. For instance, by means of the bit and
legs, we pull a polo pony on to his haunches, and then turn him with the
snaffle in order that on slippery ground we may save a slip, slide, or fall,
which would very probably occur if we let him turn on the forehand in his
own natural and easiest way. Nor does every horse, as he moves along at
the walk, trot, or gallop, or as he jumps, necessarily do so in the best or
safest way; he will often slouch, as we would describe it in a man, in doing
so. We then use the aid of bit, leg, spur, or whip to make him go up to his
bit, which we know by experience is a better fashion than his natural mode
of carrying himself.
</p>
<p>
Many a slack rider has let his horse, when he was wearily plodding his
way home after a long day’s hunting, fall and break his knees; whereas, if
the animal had been well balanced by the strong pressure of the legs and
warning spurs, and light hand on the curb, of a good and alert horseman,
he would have reached home safely.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_95" href="#FNanchor_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> The Boer system of training a horse not to fall in the antbear and
porcupine holes was to put a native on the animal and lunge it where there
were nests of these holes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_96" href="#FNanchor_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> The pose, however, of decrying <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">haute école</i> methods is a totally
mistaken one. The finest all-round horsemen in the world are the masters
of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">haute école</i>, whilst some of the worst horsemen are the butchering hard-riders
to hounds, who bunch up their reins in their mutton fists, and hold
on by them till their mount stops pulling and going. They are little better
than, though of another class to, the viceroy who said to his A.D.C.,
“Don’t talk to me now; don’t you see I am busy riding?”</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_101" href="#FNanchor_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> It has been said that “it is a peace theory that mounted infantry are
as good as trained cavalry; it is a war fact that their ignorance of horse-management
makes them five times as costly at the commencement of a
war.” However that may be, we know that under first-rate officers, a
proportion of whom have since joined the cavalry to its advantage, there
was exemplary horse-management in some corps of mounted infantry, not only
in the late South African War of 1899–1902 but long ago in the eighties.</p></div>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
